<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='large'>A GREAT WRONG.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Frank Reade was noted the world over as a wonderful and distinguished
inventor of marvelous machines in the line of steam and
electricity. But he had grown old and unable to knock about the
world, as he had been wont once to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>So it happened that his son, Frank Reade, Jr., a handsome and
talented young man, succeeded his father as a great inventor, even
excelling him in variety and complexity of invention. The son
speedily outstripped his sire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great machine shops in Readestown were enlarged by young
Frank, and new flying machines, electric wonders, and so forth, were
brought into being.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the elder Frank would maintain that, inasmuch as electricity
at the time was an undeveloped factor, his invention of the Steam
Man was really the most wonderful of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It cannot be improved upon,” he declared, positively. “Not if
steam is used as a motive power.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank, Jr. laughed quietly, and patted his father on the back.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dad,” he said, with an affectionate, though bantering air, “what
would you think if I should produce a most remarkable improvement
upon your Steam Man?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You can’t do it!” declared the senior Reade.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank, Jr., said no more, but smiled in a significant manner. One
day later, the doors of the secret draughting-room of design were
tightly locked and young Frank came forth only to his meals.</p>

<p class='c000'>For three months this matter of closed doors continued. In the
machine shop department, where the parts of machinery were secretly
put together, the ring of hammers might have been heard, and a big
sign was upon the door:</p>

<p class='c000'>No admittance!</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus matters were when one evening Frank left his arduous duties
to spend a few hours with his wife and little boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>But just as he was passing out of the yard, a darky, short in stature
and of genial features, rushed excitedly up to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Marse Frank,” cried the sable servitor, “Jes’ wait one moment!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Pomp,” said Frank, pleasantly, “what can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky, who was a faithful servant of the Reades, and had accompanied
both on their tours in foreign lands, ducked his head, with
a grin, and replied:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ father wants yo’, Marse Frank, jes’ as quick as eber yo’ kin
come!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My father,” exclaimed Frank, quickly. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know nuffin’ ‘bout it tall, Marse Frank. He jes’ say fo’ me
to tell yo’ he want fo’ to see yo’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In his library, sah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, Pomp. Tell him I will come at once.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky darted away. Frank saw that the doors to the secret
rooms were locked. This was a wise precaution for hosts of cranks
and demented inventors were always hovering about the place and
would quickly have stolen the designs if they could have got at them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not ten minutes later Frank entered the library where his father
was.</p>

<p class='c000'>The elder Reade was pacing up and down in great excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, my son, you have come at last!” he cried. “I have much
wanted to see you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am at your service, father,” replied Frank. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want you to tell me what kind of a machine you have been getting
up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come now, that’s not fair,” said Frank Jr. with twinkling eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, if it’s any kind of a machine that can travel over the prairies
tell me so,” cried the elder Reade, excitedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank, Jr., was at a loss to exactly understand what his father was
driving at. However, he replied:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I may safely say that it is. Now explain yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will,” replied the senior Reade. “I have a matter of great importance
to give you, Frank, my boy. If your invention is as good as
my steam man even, and does not improve upon it, it will yet perform
the work which I want it to do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A light broke across Frank, Jr.’s face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!” he cried. “I see what you are driving at. You have an
undertaking for me and my new machine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank, Sr., looked steadily at Frank, Jr., and replied:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have hit the nail upon the head.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“First, I must tell you a story.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would take me some time to go into the details, so I will not
attempt to do that but give you a simple statement of facts; in short,
the outline of the story.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right. Let us have it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The senior Reade cleared his throat and continued:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Many years ago when I was traveling in Australia I was set upon
by bushmen and would have been killed but for the sudden arrival
upon the scene of a countryman of mine, a man of about my own age
and as plucky as a lion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“His name was Jim Travers, and I had known him in New York
as the son of a wealthy family. He was of a roving temperament, however,
and this is what had brought him to Australia.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Travers saved my life. He beat off my assailants, and nursing
my wounds brought me back to life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have felt ever since that I owed him a debt which could not be
fully repaid. At that time I could make no return for the service.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jim and I drifted through the gold fields together. Then I lost
track of him, and until the other day I have not seen or heard from
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I now find that it is in my power to give him assistance, in
fact to partly pay the debt I owe him. This brings us to the matter
in hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Six months ago it seems that Jim who is now a man of great wealth,
still a bachelor and for a few years past living at a fashionable hotel
in New York went to his club. When he returned in the evening he
found a note worded like this:”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Reade laid a note upon the table, Frank read it:</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Travers</span>:—I would like to see you to-night upon a very
important matter. Will you meet me in twenty minutes at the cafe
on your corner. I must see you, so be sure and come.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>A Friend.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Of course Jim wondered at the note, but he did not know of an
enemy in the world, so he felt perfectly safe in keeping the appointment.
He started for the cafe.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The night was dark and misty, Jim walked along and had got near
the cafe when somebody stepped out of a dark hallway and grasped
his arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Come in here,’ a sharp voice said, ‘we can talk better here than
in the cafe.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Before Jim could make any resistance he was pulled into a dark
hallway. Two men had hold of him and something wet was dashed
across his face and over his hands, then he felt some liquid poured
over his clothes and some object thrust into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then the door opened again and he was flung out into the street.
Jim was unharmed, but amazed at such treatment. He had not been
hurt and was at a loss to understand what it all meant.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The incident had taken but a few moments in its course. At first
a thought of foul play had flashed across Jim. Then it occurred to
him to look at his hands which were wet with some substance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He gave a great cry of horror as he did so. There was blood
upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>“In fact his hands and face and clothes were almost soaked in red
blood. For an instant he was horrified.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What mystery was this? But he quickly changed his opinion and
actually laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It occurred to him as a practical joke upon the part of his club
friends. Satisfied of this he resolved to get even with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He tried to open the door, through which he had been pulled. It
was locked and would not yield.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then he decided to go back to his room and wash off the blood.
But he had not gone ten steps before he was met in the glare of the
lamplight by one of the club men.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Thunder! What’s the matter with you, Travers?’ asked his
friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Oh, nothing, only a little practical joke the boys have been playing
on me,’ replied Jim with a grin. Two or three others come along
and Jim explains in like manner. Then he goes to his apartments.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When he arrives there he is amazed to find the door open and a
fearful scene within. The furniture, the light carpet and the walls in
places are smeared with blood. Jim now got angry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘This is carrying a joke a little too far!’ he cried, testily. ‘This
spoiling the furniture is too much.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“But he went to washing the blood from his hands. This was a
hard job and took time. Suddenly half a dozen officers came into the
room and seized him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘What do you want?’ cried poor Jim in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘We want you,’ they replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘What for?’</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘For murder!’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Instead of being horrified, Jim was mad, madder than a March hare.
He just got up and swore at the officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘I don’t like this sort of thing,’ he declared. ‘It’s carrying a joke
too far.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“The officers only laughed and slipped manacles upon his wrists.
Then they led him away to prison. Not until brought into court did
poor Jim know that he had been made the victim of a hellish scheme.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Murder had really been committed in that house into which he had
been dragged, and where he was smeared with blood. A man unknown,
was there found literally carved to pieces with a knife.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Blood had been found upon Jim in his room. A trail led from the
house to his room. A knife was found in his coat pocket. The evidence
was all against him and his trial had just come off and he had
just been sentenced to death by hanging with only three months of
grace.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., listened to this thrilling tale with sensations
which the pen cannot depict. It was so horrible, so strange, so
ghastly that he could hardly believe it true.</p>

<p class='c000'>He arose and walked once across the floor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>THE NEW STEAM MAN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then the young inventor paused before his father, and in a deeply
impressed manner said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then an innocent man stands convicted of murder?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In that case it is the duty of every philanthropic man to try and
save the innocent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad to hear you say that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the question now arises as to how we shall be able to do it.
Is there no clew to the real assassins?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No definite clew.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is very strange. Of course there must have been a motive.
That motive would seem to be to get Travers out of the way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And he has no enemies?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“None that he knew of.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, but what would any one gain by putting him out of the
way——”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., paused. He gazed steadily at his father. Much
passed between them in that glance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“His fortune is a large one,” put in the senior Reade, “the right
to inherit would furnish the best motive. There is but one heir, and
he is a nephew, Artemas Cliff, who is a stockman, somewhere in the
Far West. It could not be him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Could not?” Frank Reade, Jr., sat down and dropped into a
brown study. After a time he aroused.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am interested in this case,” he declared. “And my Steam Man
is at the disposal of justice at any time. But you spoke of the prairies.
Is there a clew in the West?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The only clew possible to obtain at present,” declared Mr. Reade,
Sr. “You see detectives tracked two suspicious men to Kansas.
There they lost track of them. Everybody believes that they were
the assassins.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I believe it,” cried Frank Reade, Jr., with impulse. “I can
see but one logical explanation of this matter. Either Artemas Cliff
has employed two ruffians to do this awful deed for the sake of
Travers’ money, or—the case is one not possible to solve with ease.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Sr., did not display surprise at this statement of his
son.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now you have the whole thing in a nutshell, my boy,” he said.
“Of course, you can do as you please, but if you wish to take any
kind of a journey with your new invention, here is a chance, and a
noble object in view. That object should be to track down the murderers,
and clear Jim Travers. It may be that the nephew, Artemas
Cliff, is the really guilty one, but in any case, I believe that it is in
the West you will find the solution of the mystery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is my belief,” agreed Frank Reade, Jr., “but now that this
matter is settled let me show you the plans of my steam man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., drew a roll of papers from his pocket and spread
them upon the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon them were the blue print plans and drawings of the mechanism
of the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Senior, examined them carefully and critically. From
one piece to another he went and after some time drew a deep breath
saying:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, young blood is the best after all. I must say, Frank, that I
am beat. There is no doubt but that you have improved upon my
Steam Man. I congratulate you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you,” said Frank Reade, Jr. with gratification.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I am anxious to see this marvel at work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You shall,” replied the young inventor. “To-morrow the Steam
Man will go out of the shop upon his trial trip.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A few minutes later Frank Reade, Jr., was on the way to his own
house.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was in a particularly happy frame of mind. He had achieved
great results in his new invention, and here, as by design, was a
chance afforded him to use the Steam Man to a philanthropic and
heroic purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>The idea of traveling through the wilds of the West was a thrilling
one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank could already picture the effect of the Steam Man upon the
wild savages of the plains and the outlaws of Western Kansas and
Colorado.</p>

<p class='c000'>Also the level floor-like prairie of that region would afford excellent
traveling for the new invention.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., was a lover of adventure.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an inborn love. The prospect before him fired his very soul.
It was just what he desired.</p>

<p class='c000'>That evening he unfolded all his plans to his wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course Mrs. Reade was averse to her husband undertaking such a
dangerous trip. But after a time she overcame her scruples and reconciled
herself to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning at an early hour, Frank was at the engine house
of the steel works. The wide doors were thrown open and a wonderful
sight revealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>There stood the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Sr., and a great number of friends were present.
Pomp, the negro, was also there, as well as a queer-looking little Irishman
with a genuine Hibernian mug and twinkling eyes, which bespoke
a nature brimming over with fun. This was Barney O’Shea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp had long been faithful servants of the Reades. In
all of their travels with their inventions they had accompanied them.
Of these two characters we will say no more, but permit the reader to
become acquainted with them in the course of the story.</p>

<p class='c000'>The senior Reade examined the mechanism of the new Steam Man
with deepest interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Upon my word, Frank,” he cried, “you have beaten me out and
out. I can hardly believe my eyes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., laughed good humoredly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he went about showing a party of friends the mechanism of the
new Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man himself was a structure of iron plates joined in sections
with rivets, hinges or bars as the needs required.</p>

<p class='c000'>In face and form the machine was a good imitation of a man done
in steel.</p>

<p class='c000'>In no wise did he look ponderous or unwieldy, though his stature
was fully nine feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man stood erect holding the shafts of a wagon at his hips.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wagon itself was light but roomy with four wheels and a top
covering of fine steel net work. This was impervious to a bullet while
anyone inside could see quite well all about them.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were loop-holes in this netting to put the rifle barrels through
in case of a fight.</p>

<p class='c000'>A part of the wagon was used as a coal bunker. Other small compartments
held a limited amount of stores, ammunitions and weapons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the fender in front was a brake to regulate the wagon on a
steep grade, and a slit in the net work here allowed of the passage of
the reins, two long lines connecting with the throttle and whistle
valves. A word as to the mechanism of the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here was really the fine work of the invention.</p>

<p class='c000'>Steam was the motive power.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hollow legs and arms of the man made the reservoir or boilers.
In the broad chest was the furnace. Fully two hundred pounds of
coal could here be placed, keeping up a fire sufficient to generate
steam for a long time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The steam chest was upon the man’s back, and here were a number
of valves. The tall hat worn by the man formed the smoke stack.</p>

<p class='c000'>The driving rods, in sections, extended down the man’s legs, and
could be set in motion so skillfully that a tremendous stride was attained,
and a speed far beyond belief.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the new steam man. The improvements were many and
manifest.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the mechanism was more nicely balanced, the parts more
strongly joined, and the steel of finer quality. Greater speed was the
certainty.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Fire was burning in the furnace, steam was hissing from the retort,
and smoke was pouring from the funnel hat of the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., suddenly sprung in the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>He closed the screen door behind him. Pomp was engaged in some
work in the coal bunker.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank took up the reins and pulled them. The throttle was opened
and also the whistle valve.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three sharp shrieks the new Steam Man gave and then he was away
on the trial trip.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out of the yard he went and out upon the highway.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everybody rushed to the gates and a great cheer went up. Down
the highway went the Steam Man at a terrific gait<a id='t7'></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>His strides were long and powerful. So rapidly were they made
that a tremendous amount of surface was covered.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a good smooth road.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just ahead was a man riding a horse. Near him was a bicycler
who was noted as a fast rider.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both had heard that the Steam Man would make his trial run that
morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bets had been made by both that they could beat the Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank guessed the truth at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ki dar, Marse Frank,” cried Pomp, with a chuckle and a shake of
his woolly head. “Dem two chaps ain got a pile ob gall. Jes’ yo’
show dem dat dey ain’t in it. Won’t yo’?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp had more than one reason for beating the horse and bicycle.
He had made a small bet of his own on the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evident that the parties ahead were ready for the fun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., smiled grimly, and opened the throttle a little
wider.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment the Steam Man, the bicycle rider and the trotter
were all flying neck and neck down the road.</p>

<p class='c000'>Heavens! what a race that was!</p>

<p class='c000'>Down the road they flew like a whirlwind. The dust flew up behind
them in a cloud.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Steam Man just trotted by his competitors with seemingly
no exertion at all. Frank turned with a laugh to see how easily they
were distanced.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a good trial, the new Steam Man returned to the foundry yard.
As Frank stepped down out of the wagon, his father came up and
grasped his hand in an ecstasy of delight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bravo, my son!” he cried. “You have eclipsed my Invention. I
wish you luck, and I know that you will succeed in clearing Jim Travers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall take only Barney and Pomp with me,” said Frank Reade,
Jr. “There will not be room in the wagon for more.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, they will be useful companions,” said the Senior Reade.
“My son; may God be with you in your enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., at once proceeded to make preparations for his
western trip.</p>

<p class='c000'>He visited Travers in prison and talked with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To tell the truth, I am distrustful of my nephew, Artemas Cliff.
He is an avaricious villain, and a number of times has tried to swindle
me out of money. I know that he has led the life of an outlaw out
there on the border.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But if he aspired to gain your wealth, why did he not attempt
your life in some direct manner?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I presume he may have feared detection,” replied Travers. “If I
am hung for the murder of this unknown man, the mystery will be
sealed forever. The<a id='t7a'></a> real murderer will never be known.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe you are right,” agreed Frank Reade, Jr. “Well, I will
find this Artemas Cliff, and do the best I can toward clearing up the
mystery and setting you right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you!” said Travers with emotion. “I feel that you will
succeed.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>ON THE PLAINS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The scene of our story now undergoes a great change.</p>

<p class='c000'>We will transfer the reader from Readestown to the plains of the
Far West. Fully five hundred miles from civilization, and right in the
heart of the region of the hostile Sioux.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., had transported the Steam Man as far as possible
by rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>From thence he had journeyed the rest of the ways overland.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing of thrilling sort had as yet marked their journey. But they
were upon the verge of the most exciting adventures as the reader
will hereafter agree, possible to be experienced by man.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the broad expanse of rolling plain upon every hand, one morning
in June the Steam Man might have been seen making its way
along at a moderate gait.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., with Barney and Pomp were in the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank held the reins and his keen gaze swept the prairie in every
direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>As far as the eye could reach there remained the same broad expanse.
There was little to break the monotony.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp had taken advantage of a lull in their duties to
play a social game of poker in the rear of the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>These two unique characters, although the warmest of friends, were
nevertheless always engaged in badgering each other or the perpetration
of practical jokes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, I’ll go yez ten betther on that, yez black ape,” cried
Barney, throwing down a handful of chips. “I’ll take me worrud it’s
a big bluff yez are playin’. Yez can’t fool me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Youse will jest find out dis nigger neber plays a bluff game,” retorted
Pomp with a chuckle. “Jest yo’ look out fo’ yo’sef, Pish.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, I ain’t afraid av yez an’ I’ll go ye the tin,” cried Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a broad grin upon Pomp’s face. He quietly picked up
ten chips and then put in ten more.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hold on, Pish, I’ll go youse ten better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Call yez, be hivens!” cried Barney, chucking in ten more.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he threw down his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can yez bate that?” he cried, triumphantly. “Give us the pot,
naygur. Yez are no good.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Pomp put one black paw over the pile of chips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Jes’ wait one minnit, Pish.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whurro! Yez can’t bate it!” cried Barney, confidently.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had thrown a good hand containing four kings and two aces.
But Pomp quietly laid down four aces!</p>

<p class='c000'>The picture was one well worthy of an artist. For a moment the
two card players gazed at the six aces in amazement. It was a very
curious anomaly that there should be six aces in one pack of cards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Barney sprang up furiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s a big cheat ye are!” he cried, angrily. “Whoever
saw the loikes av that? Be me sowl, the hull pile is mine!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’ yo’ put yo’ hands on dem chips, Pish!” cried Pomp, angrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“P’raps yo’ kin tell me wharfore youse got dem two aces, maybe
youse can?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, they war in the pack, but yez kin tell me perhaps where
yez got those four aces yez put down there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I tell yo’, Pish, dey was in de pack.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be jabers it’s the fust pack av cards I ever saw with six aces in
it,” retorted Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now don’ yo’ gib me any mo’ ob yo’ sass, Pish!” blustered Pomp.
“I’ll jes’ make yo’ sorry if yo’ does.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers yez ain’t the size!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look out fo’ yo’self, Pish!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whurroo!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Over went the table leaf, down went the chips in the bottom of
the wagon, and the two angry poker players closed in a lively wrestle.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment Barney had the best of it, then Pomp tripped the
Celt up and both fell in a heap in the bottom of the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>They chanced to fall against the wire screen door in the rear of the
wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was unlocked and gave way beneath the pressure, and the two
practical jokers went through it and out upon the hard floor of the
prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were rolled about in a cloud of dust, and had they not been of
something more than ordinary composition they would have suffered
from broken bones.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as it was both picked themselves up unhurt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man had gone on fully one hundred yards before Frank
Reade, Jr., perceived that his companions were missing, and at once
closed the throttle and brought the Man to a halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Serves the rascals right,” muttered Frank, as he saw them pick
themselves up from the dust. “They are always skylarking, and no
good comes of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had stopped the Steam Man. He waited for the two jokers
to pick themselves up and return to the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>But at that moment a thrilling thing occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp had fallen near a clump of timber.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this with wild yells a band of mounted Sioux Indians now
dashed.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were a war party—painted and bedecked with feathers, and in
the full paraphernalia of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>The peril which threatened the two jokers was one not to be despised.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was quite evident that the savages meant to cut off their rejoining
the Steam Man. In that case their fate would be sealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Barney was quick-witted, and saw the situation at a glance.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a wild howl he broke into a mad run for the Steam Man. It
was a question of life or death and he ran as he had never ran before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp was not so lucky. While Barney was distancing his pursuers,
and actually succeeded in reaching the wagon, the darky suddenly
found himself cut off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indian ponies were circling about him, the red riders whooping and
yelling like veritable demons.</p>

<p class='c000'>The poor darky was beside himself with terror and perplexity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly sakes alibe!” he yelled, with his wool literally standing on
end. “Whatebber am dis yer nigger gwine fo’ to do? I’se a gone coon
fo’ suah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It certainly looked that way. The savages circled nearer and half a
dozen of them dismounted and rushed upon Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now the darky was unarmed.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had not even a pistol or a knife. Of course he was at their mercy.</p>

<p class='c000'>In less time than it takes to tell it, the savages had closed in about
the terrified darky, and he was quickly thrown upon his back and
bound.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he was laid across the back of a pony and tied on securely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a lariat was attached to the pony’s bridle, and the savages
with their prisoner in their midst dashed away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney had reached the Steam Man and climbed into the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., had seen the whole affair, and for a moment was
too astounded to act.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then as Barney came tumbling into the wagon, Frank turned the
man around and sent him flying toward the savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>This move was quickly made, and the Steam Man ran forward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>rapidly. But quick as it had been, the savages had yet succeeded in
making Pomp a prisoner and getting away with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be jabers, they’ve got the naygur bound to a horse,” cried Barney,
wildly. “Wud yez luk at the loikes, Misther Frank. We must catch
the omadhouns and give them a lessin of the right sort.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope we may,” replied Frank, with great anxiety, “but I fear
the red fiends will get to cover before we can overtake them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whurroo! It’s mesilf as will sphoil the loike av some av thim,”
cried Barney, as he picked up his rifle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The savages were racing like mad across the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had caught sight of the Steam Man, which was to them some
fiend incarnate, some evil spirit which would seek their certain destruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Terror of the wildest sort made them whip their ponies to the utmost.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a mad race.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Steam Man was gaining.</p>

<p class='c000'>He took tremendous strides. Frank pulled the whistle valve, and
the shrieks sent up on the air were of a terrifying kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The savages had all gazed with wonder upon the white man’s iron
horse that followed its steel track across their prairies.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this latest appearance, the Steam Man, was too much for their
nerves. They could not bear it, and fled.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man would certainly have overtaken them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, not visible until one had turned the timber line and made a
rise in the prairie was a distant range of hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward this the savages were going. If they reached them, they
would certainly succeed in eluding their pursuer.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the chances seemed good.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw, with a peculiar chill, that they were really liable to
reach the point aimed at.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sent the man on at full speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney placed himself at a loop-hole, and commenced firing as rapidly
as he could at the fleeing foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result was that many of them fell, and the others redoubled
their exertions to make an escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>On went the chase toward the distant range of hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearer and nearer drew the ponies to the objective point.</p>

<p class='c000'>With sinking heart Frank saw that the Indians were likely to reach
them before the Steam Man could overtake them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course this would mean safety for the savages, for the Steam Man
could not hope to follow the ponies over the rough surfaces there encountered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heavens, we are not going to save Pomp!” cried Frank, with a
thrill of despair in his voice. “What shall we do, Barney? Is it not
awful?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was busily engaged in placing fresh cartridges in his Winchester.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s save the naygur I will if I sacrifice me own loife!”
cried the big-hearted Celt. “It’s me own fault, for sure, that he iver
fell troo the door and got picked up by the red min.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank put on all the steam he dared, and the man took tremendous
strides forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will make a mighty effort,” he gritted, as he piled on the
steam.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, here goes for wan av the spalpeens!” cried Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Irishman’s rifle cracked.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the savages tumbled from his pony’s back.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney continued to load and fire as fast as he could. But the opportunity
was not long granted him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly the cavalcade of savages dashed into the mouth of the
pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were out of sight in a twinkling. The Steam Man was obliged
to come to a halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were huge bowlders and piles of stones to block the passage.
Barney and Frank Reade, Jr., exchanged glances of despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is the end of Pomp,” declared the young inventor, with a
chill. “I have no doubt that is a part of Black Buffalo’s band, and
he never spares a life.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE COWBOYS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Frank had spoken truthfully. The band of savages was really a
part of the tribe of which Black Buffalo was the chief.</p>

<p class='c000'>Throughout all the Kansas border this blood thirsty fiend was
known and feared.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had ravaged more wagon trains, burned more settlements, and
committed more massacres than any other Sioux chief in the Far
West.</p>

<p class='c000'>His name was a synonym of terror among the settlers, from Dakota
to the boundary line of Texas.</p>

<p class='c000'>By many he was claimed to be a white man or renegade. Others
averred that he was a recreant Pawnee chief.</p>

<p class='c000'>However this was, certainly no red warrior was better known and
feared than Black Buffalo.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it was into his hands that Pomp had fallen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Small wonder then that Frank Reade, Jr., was much alarmed, and
even inclined to believe his faithful servitor’s life lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>The merciless Black Buffalo would not be likely to spare Pomp’s
life. The savages had captured him alive simply to drag him into the
hills and torture him to death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney began to bemoan the situation in violent terms.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Och hone, the poor soul,” he cried, “he was a black naygur but
he had a white heart jist that same. Be jabers av’ we cud only get
near enough to the red omadhouns I’d loike to shoot ivery mother’s
son av thim.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I don’t see why the red fiends haven’t the best of us,” declared
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It luks that same, Misther Frank,” wailed Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t see how we can ever get through that pass. The Steam Man
might go there, but the wagon won’t.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was true enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man on the level prairie was invincible, but on rough
ground like this wholly useless.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Barney were beside themselves with solicitude and perplexity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank even thought of going forth on foot to try and overtake the
redskins. But of course the folly of such a course was quickly apparent
to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney even attempted to carry out literally this plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went so far as to open the door in the wire screen and leap
down to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank cried sternly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney, come back at once. You can gain nothing by such a
course.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, Mr. Frank,” cried the Irishman, “if yez will only let me
go——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come back,” was Frank’s terse command, which was reluctantly
obeyed by the Celt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank took a careful look at the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>He chanced to see a smooth pathway up the height, and which
seemed to follow the course of the canyon or pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up this the Steam Man cautiously advanced. As they continued to
ascend higher a good broad view of the prairie was obtained.</p>

<p class='c000'>And suddenly reaching an elevation from which a southward view
could be obtained, Frank gave a sharp cry, and taking a glass from a
locker, sprung to a loop-hole in the netting.</p>

<p class='c000'>He scanned a number of objects upon the prairie far beyond.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that distance they looked like a herd of buffaloes.</p>

<p class='c000'>But with the glass Frank saw that they were mounted men and
white men at that.</p>

<p class='c000'>They looked like a roving band of cowboys. In any event they were
white men and it was quite enough for the young inventor to know
this.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can depend upon them to help rescue Pomp!” cried Frank,
exuberantly. “Luck is yet with us, Barney.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be jabers I hope so,” cried the excited Celt. “If they be white
men and have a heart they’ll shurely do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank instantly turned the wagon about and sent the Steam Man
rapidly down to the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>He blew shrill blasts upon the whistle to attract the attention of the
white men.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this he was successful.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Steam Man reached the prairie floor, the cavalcade or cowboys
came dashing up.</p>

<p class='c000'>They did not seem surprised at sight of the Steam Man somewhat
singularly and drew up fifty yards distant while one of their number
rode forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was evidently the leader, and was a tall, dark, evil-looking fellow.
Frank Reade, Jr. was not favorably impressed with his appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the young inventor noted that the whole gang had a forbidding
appearance and with a chill Frank realized that he could hardly expect
any assistance from such a cut-throat looking band.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tall, dark leader doffed his sombrero as he rode forward and
made a low bow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Buenos Senors!” he said with a Spanish accent. “I wish you a
fair day. Do you travel far with your Iron Man?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad to meet you,” replied Frank, eagerly. “We come
from the East and we are here upon an important mission.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The stranger smiled and bowed again with a peculiar affectation of
politeness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am pleased to hear it. Are you not the gentleman called
Frank Reade, Jr.?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank gave a start of surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am,” he replied, quickly, “then you have heard of me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have, Senor Reade,” replied the cowboy chief, with another exaggerated
bow and smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps you know of my mission here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was more amazed than words can express. What mystery
was this?</p>

<p class='c000'>How had this fellow, who bore the stamp of a Spaniard, learned of
his mission to the Far West? The young inventor was staggered for
a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your mission here,” replied the cowboy chief, politely, “is to hunt
down two men who you believe are guilty of a murder which they
skillfully foisted upon a certain man by the name of Jim Travers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right!” cried Frank. “But how in the name of wonder
did you know that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I prefer not to say. It is enough that I know it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is strange that you should have learned it,” said Frank, “but
I will ask no more questions just now in the face of a terrible exigency.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want to ask your help.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My help?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>“Yes”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pardon, senor, but I cannot see in what manner I can serve you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must assist me. One of my men—a colored man—has fallen
into the hands of the Indians. They have made him prisoner and
have just escaped with him into these hills. I ask your assistance in
effecting his rescue.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A peculiar smile played about the cowboy’s lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is he not the one you call Pomp?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And that man with you in your cage there is called Barney?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, I see—Barney and Pomp. Well, Senor Reade, pray accept
my compliments and the wish that you may see civilization again alive,
which I do not believe will be the case. Ha—ha—ha! You have blundered
into a death-trap!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Something like a correct comprehension of affairs now began to
dawn upon Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean?” he gasped in surprise. “Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, since you ask me I will tell you,” replied the cowboy chief
with a laugh. “I am no Spaniard, as you might have thought. I
am as good an American as you, and you will have good cause to remember
my name in the near future, provided you escape from this
trap. I am the man you are so eagerly looking for—I am Artemas
Cliff.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heavens!” gasped Frank Reade, Jr., “the man I am looking
for!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The same,” replied Cliff, mockingly. “You have undertaken
quite a daring deed, my fine inventor, but you will find that you have
bitten off a very much larger slice than you can masticate.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will see,” began Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see these men?” continued Cliff. “They are my followers,
tried and true. What is it to you whether my uncle, Jim Travis,
should hang for murder? You can never prove him innocent—at
least, never will, for you will never go from here alive.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Scoundrel!” cried Frank. “You are the real murderer!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ha, ha, ha! Prove it if you can!” laughed the cowboy chief, derisively.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will prove it, if I have to drag the confession from your lips!”
cried Frank, resolutely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pshaw! Talk is cheap. Attention, men! Grab the throttle rein
of the Steam Man and you can destroy him! Forward! Charge!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., heard the command and knew well the danger.
He was at a loss to account for Cliff’s knowledge of him and his invention.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor was not aware of the fact that for weeks previous
to the starting forth of the Steam Man spies had been busy in
Readestown.</p>

<p class='c000'>But such was the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Artemas Cliff had covered his tracks well. He knew that Frank
Reade, the young inventor’s father, was a friend of Travers and would
see him through, if possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore he had provided well for giving Frank Reade, Jr., and the
new Steam Man a hot reception on the plains.</p>

<p class='c000'>With hoarse cries the cowboys descended upon the Steam Man.
They urged their horses forward at a full gallop.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., knew well that it was possible for them to greatly
injure his invention, so he made quick action to defeat their plans.</p>

<p class='c000'>He shouted to Barney:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give it to them, Barney. Shoot every man you can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank opened the throttle, and let the Steam Man out for all
he was worth.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an easy matter to outstrip the horses, and the Steam Man
kept ahead, while the cowboys came thundering on in the rear.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank slackened speed so as to keep up a uniform distance
between the Man and the horses.</p>

<p class='c000'>While Barney poured in shot after shot into the midst of the gang
of pursuers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys began to drop from their saddles one by one. It was
a destructive and telling fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>And they strained every nerve in vain in an effort to reach the
Steam Man. Frank kept the Man just far enough ahead to ensure
safety and enable Barney to pick off the cowboys with ease.</p>

<p class='c000'>It took Cliff some time to tumble to this little game.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he did, and realized that he was simply decimating numbers
without gaining ground, he called a halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys were now near the banks of a wide river which was
really the Platte. Frank Reade, Jr. saw his advantage and brought
the Steam Man to a stop. Then he seized a rifle and joined Barney.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>POMP’S RESCUE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>But it was hardly likely that the cowboys would stand their ground
long under such a fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>As fast as they could Frank and Barney worked the repeaters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The result was that quite a number of the foe lay dead upon the
prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Artemas Cliff knew the fatality of remaining there. Being unable
to catch the man, he knew that their only hope now was in retreat.</p>

<p class='c000'>All of the cowboys fired at the Steam Man. The bullets rattled
harmlessly against the steel cage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank at once sprang to the reins and the brake and started the
Steam Man in pursuit. It was quite a turning of tables.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pursuers were now the pursued.</p>

<p class='c000'>So it continued until suddenly, by the orders of Cliff, the cowboys
turned their horses into the river and forded it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once on the other side they were soon beyond the reach of the rifle
balls. The Steam Man of course could not follow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The encounter with the cowboys was at an end.</p>

<p class='c000'>They did not return to the attack, somewhat singularly, but kept
on until the rolling plains hid them from view.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cliff’s direful threat against the Steam Man and its inventor, had
not been carried out. But Frank did not, by any means, delude himself
with the belief that the villain would relinquish the attempt so
easily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Barney,” he cried, cheerily, when satisfied that the scrimmage
was over. “We came out of that scrape a little the best of it.
It has all turned out as I expected. That Cliff is the real murderer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it luks that way, Misther Frank,” agreed Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So it does. We must plan to capture the villain, and wring a
confession from him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be jabers that’s thrue. If I only had an opportunity I’d pretty
quick wring his loon neck for him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But that does not settle the question of Pomp’s fate,” declared
Frank. “He must be saved.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, Misther Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how can we do it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was yet a conundrum.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and the faithful Irishman stood looking at each other. It
was a long time before either spoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally Frank said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s only one way, Barney.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“An’ phwat’s that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ve got to got into those hills in some way. I don’t like to
leave the Steam Man, but to save Pomp I’d——”</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor ceased speaking. A strange medley of sounds
came from the direction of the pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were wild yells and pistol shots, and then, out upon the prairie,
the two astonished travelers saw a motley crew of horses and savages
emerge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The savages were fighting furiously. Frank knew enough of the
Indians of that region to know what it all meant.</p>

<p class='c000'>A band of Sioux and a band of Pawnees, the deadliest of enemies,
were engaged in a terrific battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank took in the scene at a glance.</p>

<p class='c000'>He at once understood all.</p>

<p class='c000'>The band which had captured Pomp was undoubtedly the one engaged
in this conflict. They had very likely met the Pawnees in the
upper part of the pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Pawnees and Sioux met a fight always followed. Generally
the latter came off victorious.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it seemed now, however, the Pawnees had the best of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were worsting the Sioux in good fashion. Frank and Barney
watched the scene a moment until suddenly a sharp cry burst from
Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, Misther Frank, if there ain’t the naygur.” he cried,
wildly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was right. Frank glanced in the direction indicated and
saw a thrilling act.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the midst of the Sioux was Pomp bound to the back of a mustang.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly in the midst of the melee the horse was seen to bolt from
the rest and dash out upon the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, Pomp had no control over the beast, having his hands
tied behind him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mustang took his own course and ran like the wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Sioux did not dare to any of them attempt pursuit. The foe in
their front claimed their attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, the horse is runnin’ away wid the naygur,” cried Barney.
“Phwat will we do, Misther Frank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Catch him if we can,” cried Frank, seizing the throttle rein.</p>

<p class='c000'>He opened the throttle and let the Steam Man go ahead; with long
strides the machine began to gain upon the mustang.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp was vainly endeavoring to free his hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>If he could have done so, and could have got hold of the reins once,
he could easily have stopped the horse.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this he was unable to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a result, the animal carried him along swiftly, and along the
base of the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly the mustang swerved and darted into a narrow pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney, at the loop-holes of the wagon with rifle in hand, had been
sorely tempted to fire at the runaway.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the fear of hitting Pomp had restrained him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, however, the horse was out of range. But Frank headed the
Steam Man for the pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately, it was unobstructed by bowlders, and had a good level
floor. The Steam Man was enabled to forge along with safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the mustang and his black rider had gone from sight. However
the pursuers kept on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly they came out upon a broad plateau with steep descent
upon all other sides. This extended among the hills for a distance of
several miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great cry of horror now went up from Frank and Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mustang was seen racing along the edge of a mighty chasm.
In a few seconds he would be almost sure to take an impossible leap
over a deep gorge.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>If he should go to the bottom of that gorge it would be the end of
Pomp and the mustang.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was seen at a glance and with the most intense of horror Barney
cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shall I fire, Misther Frank? It’s the only thing as will save the
naygur.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will have to do that,” replied Frank, sharply. “Look out
for your aim, Barney. God help Pomp!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crack!</p>

<p class='c000'>The bullet sped true to its mark. It struck the mustang in the
side.</p>

<p class='c000'>The animal faltered, threw up its head, stumbled, and then pitched
forward in a heap.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp lay beneath the horse. It did not require but a few moments
for the Steam Man to reach him, however.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a twinkling Barney sprang out of the wagon and cut Pomp’s
bonds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky was not in the least injured. He lay with one leg under
the mustang, but was easily extricated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The joy of the darky at his rescue cannot be expressed in words.</p>

<p class='c000'>He embraced Barney effusively.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure I thought yez kilt intoirely, naygur,” cried the big-hearted
Irishman. “It’s moighty glad I am to see yez aloive.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ kin jest bet dis chile am glad fo’ to get out ob dem red debbils’
hands,” cried Pomp, exuberantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>And then he dashed aboard the Steam Man and grasped Frank’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Marse Frank, I’se dretful glad to see yo’!” cried Pomp, excitedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad to have you back, Pomp,” cried Frank. “And to know
that you are unharmed in any way. But it was a close shave for you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Deed it was dat, Marse Frank. But dis nigger am powerful hard
for to kill, an’ specs dat’s why I lib. But I’se got lots to tell you,
Marse Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have?” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Deed I has. P’raps yo’ kin find it valuable fo’ yo’. I’ll jes’ tell
yo’ dat when we went up troo dat pass we jes’ cum out pretty quick
in a valley. Dat ar’ valley was a scrumptious one, an’ dar was a trail
leadin’ down inter it. But afore the Injuns could ride down inter it
along cum six white men on hossback an’ a right pert young lady on
a hoss, too.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sakes alibe I nebber seen so pretty a gal in all mah life. Well,
dese yer men, dey seemed like dey was ‘quainted wid der Injuns. Dey
jes’ talked as free like wid old Black Buffalo, an’ I jes’ opened my ears
an’ listened.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dey said dat de gal was a prisoner an’ dey was takin’ her from a
cave in de hills to Ranch V. Dey mentioned de name ob Artemas
Cliff. Den dey rode on, sah, an’ mah sakes, jus’ den up from the valley
dere came a hull gang ob Ingines and pitched into us. Ob cose
yo’ know all de res’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., listened with the deepest amazement to this exciting
story.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A young girl!” he gasped. “Of course those men were Cliff’s,
but where on earth were they going?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dey done said it was to Ranch V. sah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ranch V!” repeated Frank. “That is not very definite. But it
must be the headquarters of Cliff and his gang. You didn’t hear them
say just where that ranch was located, Pomp?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No sah, but I jes’ took note ob de direckshun dey was goin’ an’ it
was to de souf-west.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said the young inventor as he turned the Steam Man
about, “I cannot imagine who the young girl is or how she fell into
the hands of Cliff’s gang. But it is certain that she is in their power
and we must save her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be jabers that’s roight, Misther Frank,” cried Barney, gallantly,
“the O’Sheas from Brian Boru down war always known as men av
honor an’ defenders av female virtue.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man started on the return across the plateau.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Frank Reade, Jr.’s intention to reach the prairie once more
and strike out to the southwest, in the hopes of locating the Ranch V.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man ran swiftly to the mouth of the pass which led down
to the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney had filled the furnace with fresh coal, and the indicator
showed that there was plenty of water in the boiler.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was about to enter the pass when suddenly Pomp sprang up
with a wild cry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky sprang to Frank’s side and tried to grab the throttle rein.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was astounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hold on there, Pomp. What are you trying to do?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ki dar, Marse Frank. Stop de Man, or fo’ de Lawd we am all
done fo’, suah as preachin’!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What?” gasped Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If yo’ don’t believe it, jes look up yonder?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp pointed one finger upward to the canyon wall above the pass.
The sight which rewarded the startled gaze of the young inventor
caused him to reverse the throttle and bring the Steam Man to a halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two cowboys were crouching behind an enormous bowlder which
they had intended to roll down upon the Steam Man.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FIGHT IN THE PASS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A more narrow escape could hardly be imagined.</p>

<p class='c000'>The precipitation of the huge bowlder upon the Steam Man would
have destroyed the invention and the lives of those on board.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just in time Pomp had seen the danger. Another moment and it
would have been too late.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ki yi, don’ yo’ see now, Marse Frank?” cried Pomp, wildly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see,” replied Frank, in thrilled tones. “My God! that is a narrow
shave. We would have been crushed to atoms in another moment
as I live.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whurroo! Give the spalpeens a good bit av cold lead!” shouted
Barney, rushing to one of the loop-holes with his rifle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s right!” cried Frank, doing the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, yo’ kin bet we will do dat!” chimed in Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two cowboys, seeing that their game was exposed, sprang up
with wild shouts of dismay.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they did so they were exposed to shots from below. The three
rifles spoke sharply in chorus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two would be destroyers tumbled in a heap. Their fall was followed
by a wild chorus of yells from the thickets and bowlder piles
above.</p>

<p class='c000'>A volley of bullets came from there and rattled harmlessly against
the steel netting, showing that the cowboys were there located in
great force.</p>

<p class='c000'>How they had chanced to be there at that critical moment our adventurers
could only guess.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank mentally concluded that at best they were but a division
of Cliff’s gang, and they had happened upon the spot by chance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing the Steam Man they had seized what seemed to them a fine
opportunity to destroy it.</p>

<p class='c000'>How far short they came of it we have already seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>A red-hot contest now began between the cowboys and those in the
steel wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course our three friends had a vast advantage inasmuch as they
were protected from the shots of their foes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course the outlaws far outnumbered them, but it was not at all
a difficult matter to pick them off occasionally with a rifle bullet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Volley after volley the cowboys fired at the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>When at length it became patent to them that their shots were futile,
they made the air ring with yells of baffled rage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they ceased firing and silence ensued. Every cowboy had
disappeared seemingly from the canyon wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this did not deceive Frank Reade, Jr.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that this was only a game of the foe and that it would yet
be unsafe to try the pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, ain’t there some other way av gettin’ out av this place?”
cried Barney, giving the plateau a sweeping glance.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the chain of hills surrounding it did not lend color to such a
possibility.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It don’t look like it,” said Frank, dubiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I jes’ fink dat am de only way out ob dis place,” said Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are in a kind of trap,” declared Frank Reade, Jr. “We
were not sharp or we would have avoided this scrape.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As it was, however, the best they could do was to watch for an opportunity
to run the gauntlet through the Pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they had not long to wait for new and thrilling developments.
Suddenly Pomp gave a startled cry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For massy sakes, Marse Frank, jes’ yo’ look out yonder. Whatebber
am dey up to now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Over the edge of the plateau there was visible a line of men advancing
rapidly toward the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were deploying right and left as if to surround him. This was
certainly their purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’re thryin’ to surround us!” cried Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank watched the maneuver with deep interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled grimly.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was certainly the purpose of the foe. But the young inventor
saw in the move a betterment of his own chances.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They will not gain what they hope to,” he said, resolutely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he saw that a line of armed men had deployed across the
mouth of the Pass to prevent the Steam Man from escaping in that
direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Frank’s judgment there were fully two hundred cowboys in the
party. This was tremendous odds, but the young inventor did not
fear the results.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a wild cheer the cowboys began to close their line in about
the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., opened the whistle valve and let out several defiant
shrieks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he started the Steam Man in a straight line for the pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp and Barney with their repeaters began to fire upon the line of
men there.</p>

<p class='c000'>The repeaters did deadly work.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a constant fusillade, and the cowboys dropped like sheep.
The error of their plan could now be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>In dividing their forces to make the surrounding line, they had
weakened themselves. Frank had seen this.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they had been merely content with holding the pass, it would
have been extremely doubtful if the Steam Man could so easily have
escaped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as fast as they could work the sixteen-shot Winchesters, Barney
and Pomp mowed down the opposing line of cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>The line was thin, and it would have required a very solid corps to
have withstood that scathing fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down went the Steam Man toward the Pass with fearful speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Heaps of the dead and wounded cowboys lay upon the ground. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the Steam Man reached the Pass, a number of the cowboys tried to
grasp the throttle reins and stop the machine.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the ponderous body of the Man knocked them aside like flies
and the wheels of the heavy wagon crushed them into death or insensibility.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man literally forged his way through the Pass like a
rocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp cheered wildly and fired parting shots at the discomfited
foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments the Steam Man ran out upon the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank did not waste time but set his course at once to the Southwest.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was anxious to locate Ranch V. This he believed was his first
and most important duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was satisfied that nothing was to be gained by remaining in the
hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was confident that Cliff had gone to the Ranch V wherever it
was. More than all else, he was powerfully interested in the mysterious
young lady as described by Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was determined to know who she was, and what Cliff held her in
captivity for.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day was rapidly drawing to a close.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a short while the hills faded out of sight, and the rolling
prairie was visible upon every hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, as the Steam Man look his long strides across the even plain,
Frank suddenly caught sight of a beaten path or trail.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was plainly a trail much used and bore a trifle east of south.
Frank brought the Man to a stop.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I would like to know where that trail goes to?” he declared. “I
am not sure but it is the route to Ranch V.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, Marse Frank!” cried Pomp, craning his neck and looking
to the southward a little ways. “What am dat jus’ ober dat roll in
de perairy?? Am not dat some berry sumspicious objec’?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank gazed in the direction indicated and saw a tall, black-looking
timber seeming to rise out of the roll in the prairie. But he knew
that it was beyond.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank let the Steam Man go along for a quarter of a mile, and topping
the rise a startling sight was revealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>There, scattered over several acres of land were the blackened ruins
and charred timbers of some buildings.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was easy to see what these buildings had constituted.</p>

<p class='c000'>A large ranch with stockade, extensive cattle pens and yards, had
once stood upon this spot. Frank allowed the Steam Man to pass
through the ruins.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thrilling sights were accorded our adventurers.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were heaps of ashes, the bones of animals, and several
charred skeletons of human beings.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was every evidence that a fight had occurred at the place, and
that the ranch had been burned by either Indians or rival cowboys.
As chance had it the sign which, painted in broad letters, had once
hung over the yard gate, had not been destroyed, and lay upon the
ground near.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our explorers were enabled to read it plainly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Rodman Ranch.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp descended from the wagon, and spent some
time in exploring the ruins.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I jes’ fink de Ingines burned up dis yer place,” averred Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s the divil’s own job they med av it,” declared Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank said, with conviction:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just as likely it was the work of Cliff and his gang. They are outlaws
at best, and if Rodman Ranch was a respectable place, they
would be sure to wish it destroyed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp re-entered the wagon now, and once more the
quest for Ranch V was begun.</p>

<p class='c000'>But night came on, and they had obtained no clew.</p>

<p class='c000'>A good place was found to camp, and it was decided to wait until
morning before pursuing the journey further.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly everything was made comfortable with this end in
view.</p>

<p class='c000'>No camp fire was made, for this was not deemed necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>At night they always slept in the wagon, and Barney and Pomp
served turns in watching.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fires in the furnace were banked, and the Steam Man was given
a rest just the same as the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>One place was always as good as another in camping out thus, save
that it was necessary to be near a body of water, so that the boilers
could be filled with ease the next morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man was thus cared for, the fires banked, and everything
made shipshape when, after Barney had been on watch not more than
two hours, the first of a series of thrilling incidents occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night was as dark as Erebus, not a star twinkled in the ether,
for heavy black clouds overhung all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly Barney saw a light glimmering far out on the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>It increased to quite a respectable size and continued to blaze for a
long time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt watched it for a long while. Then his curiosity got the
better of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, that’s quare,” he muttered. “I’ll make sure there’s
something wrong about that now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney, acting upon impulse, leaned over and grasped Frank’s
shoulder. The young inventor awoke with a start.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE VIGILANTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“W-what’s the matter?” gasped Frank, sleepily arousing himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whist now, Misther Frank! There’s a quare loight out yonder on
the perairy, an’ I thought I’d jist call yure attintion to the same,
sor.?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A light?” muttered Frank, now fully awake.</p>

<p class='c000'>He got upon his feet, and rubbing his eyes, stared at the distant
blaze.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is odd,” he muttered. “It will do to investigate that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sure, it may be a camp fire,” ventured Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If so, then we must find out who the campers are,” declared
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was but an instant’s work to arouse Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the fires in the furnace were started, a line of hose was run to
a creek near, and the boiler was filled.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an incredible short space of time steam was got up, and the
Steam Man moved ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank held the throttle reins and directed the Steam Man’s course
toward the distant camp fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>For such it was, as became evident as they drew near.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first no movement was made by the camping party, and Frank
fancied that they had nobody on guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as the Steam Man with clanking tread came within one hundred
yards of the camp, a wild shout went up and a gun was discharged at
the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was now able to see the circle of the camp as revealed by the
firelight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Men had been rolled in blankets upon the ground to the number of
a score.</p>

<p class='c000'>But these were now upon their feet. Just beyond it could be seen
that mustangs were corralled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., had no way of knowing whether the campers were
friends or foes.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had fancied them a part of Cliff’s cowboys. Still there was a
possibility they were not.</p>

<p class='c000'>At any rate he could not treat them as foes until he learned positively
that they were such.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he brought the Steam Man to a stop just fifty yards from the
camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scene in the camp now was a ludicrous one.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men were filled with mingled fear, amazement and stupefaction
at the sight of the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fiery eyes and nostrils and mammoth proportions of the man in
the darkness made him look like a monster from the infernal regions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The startled cries of the campers came to the amused hearing of
those in the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great Jericho! What d’yer call that thing?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s the devil hisself!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He’s arter us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That last drink at ther cross trails was too much for us boys.
We’ve got ‘em bad.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I reckon we’d better fix up a prayer. Ther old gentleman has cum
to git us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp exploded with laughter. It was very funny.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as soon as the pandemonium had for a moment subsided, Frank
Reade, Jr. hastened to shout:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’re human beings the same as you. Have no fear. Who
are you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The words had an astounding effect upon the campers. After a
moment of stupefied silence the answer came back.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who the dickens are you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am Frank Reade, Jr., and this is my new invention, the Steam
Man,” replied Frank. “You have nothing to fear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The campers now saw the three men in the wagon as Barney turned
on the light of the calcium and illuminated the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>At once their fear fled and a comprehension of all dawned upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A steam Man, by thunder, and built all of iron!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wall, that beats all!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’ll come next?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That beats the iron hoss all holler!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The campers now came thronging about the wagon. As the number
was limited, Frank did not feel particularly uneasy, though he
held the throttle ready and Barney and Pomp had their repeaters at
hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the fears of our three adventurers were quickly allayed.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the men, a tall, powerful framed man, came forward, and
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wall, cap’en, we’re glad to meet you an’ yer Steam Man. My
name is Sim Harmon, an’ I’m captain of this band, who are all Vigilants
from Poker Gulch. We’re out on the trail of a gang of ruffians.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Vigilants!” cried Frank Reade, Jr., with joy. “Then you are not
members of the Artemas Cliff gang?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Artemas Cliff!” cried Harmon. “He is the chap we want. If we
can lay hands on him we’ll stretch his neck, you bet. D’yer know
whar we kin find him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am on his trail myself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The deuce ye are?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s the truth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank opened the door of the wagon, and descending shook hands
with the Vigilant captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>He told him explicitly of the mysterious murder of which Jim Travers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>had been adjudged guilty, but which it was believed was the work
of Cliff.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harmon listened with interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So that’s another game of ther cuss!” he cried. “Wall, that’s a
bad one, but I reckon we’ve a wuss count agin him, stranger.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed!” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did ye cum across ther ruins of a ranch out hyar on ther perairy
some miles?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wall, that was onct Rodman Ranch, an’ Ralph Rodman was one
of the best men in this part of ther West. But that ornery cuss Cliff
fell in love with pretty Bessie Rodman, his darter, an’ when Ralph
denied him the right to come a-courtin’ her, ther scoundrel jest
brought down a gang of hoodlums an’ burned down the ranch, toted
off ther gal, an’ killed all ther rest about ther place.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Horrible!” exclaimed Frank. “But you have not told me of Rodman.
What became of him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wall, that illustrates ther villainy of ther cuss. Just previous to
burnin’ ther ranch, two men, Sid Bowen an’ Jem Ducey, hired by
Cliff, enticed Ralph to New York by bringin’ him a bogus message
from a brother, who was represented as bein’ in great distress. That’s
the last seen of Rodman. What they did with him we don’t know.
But I’ve heard that Bowen an’ Ducey have returned, an’ Rodman
didn’t cum with ‘em. It’s my belief he’s been done away with, an’
it’s all a game of Cliff’s to get the gal Bessie into his possession.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A great cry broke from the lips of Frank Reade, Jr.</p>

<p class='c000'>This story of Harmon’s he had listened to eagerly, and, as it was
unfolded, bit by bit, a clear, concise comprehension of all now came
to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw the hideous details, the cold, scheming construction of a
deep and awful plot, involving murder and abduction and terrible
wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great heavens!” he gasped, wiping cold perspiration from his
brow. “Your story throws a great light upon the matter which I
have in hand, Mr. Harmon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The deuce you say!” gasped the captain of the Vigilantes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is the truth,” cried Frank. “I think I can tell you the true
fate of Ralph Rodman, and you will agree that Cliff is the projector of
one of the most awful double plots of crime that human being could
be capable of.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Vigilantes all gathered around the young inventor, agog with
interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ye don’t mean it?” gasped Harmon, with amazement. “Ye’re
huntin’ Cliff then ther same as we are?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What fer?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To force a confession or explanation from him of a mysterious
murder of which his own uncle, James Travers, of New York, has
been adjuged guilty and who is now in prison awaiting his sentence
of hanging about a year from now.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, this villain is a deep one. But I have told you of that mysterious
murder and, as Heaven is my judge, I believe the victim of
that murder which was purposely thrown upon Travers was Rodman.
You see Cliff’s object in throwing the murder upon Travers was to see
him hang and thus inherit his vast wealth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment after this statement silence reigned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Appalled with the magnitude of the villain’s plot all remained silent.
But the mystery was cleared up at last.</p>

<p class='c000'>All understood now exactly the deep game of Artemas Cliff.</p>

<p class='c000'>But one sentiment reigned supreme in the breasts of all. Artemas
Cliff should be brought to justice.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was easy enough to see how the wretch in planning to win Bessie
Rodman had enticed Rodman to the East and there murdered him.
Then to kill two birds with one stone he had caused the awful crime
by clever circumstantial evidence to be thrown upon his wealthy uncle,
James Travers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, with Travers’ death, he would inherit the millions left by
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ralph Rodman was dead. The ranch was a heap of ashes.</p>

<p class='c000'>For these crimes Artemas Cliff was responsible. But Bessie Rodman
was yet in his power. Travers was near the gallows.</p>

<p class='c000'>These two people must be saved.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., saw the mission, as did Harmon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instinctively they clasped hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I reckon we both know what to do,” declared the Vigilant captain
tersely. “P’r’aps we kin work together. I’ll help you all I kin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I will help you,” replied Frank. “We will bring Cliff to justice
if the Steam Man can help us to do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He will hang if I kin get my hands onto him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But we must make no mistake. He is strongly backed up. You
have only twenty-five men with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But they air all men,” replied Harmon, pluckily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will not question that,” replied Frank, “but the weight of numbers
would defeat you. Cliff has several hundred men in his command.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’re not afraid of ‘em. Yet ye’re right enuff. It’s well fer us to
go easy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is well to be careful,” said Frank. “I think that you had better
keep along with us for a time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think there is no doubt but that the young girl whom Pomp saw
in the hills was Bessie Rodman.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In course it was her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They were taking her to Ranch V. Do you know where it is?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yas,” replied Harmon, quickly, “that’s on Stone River, an’ it’s a
pesky big place too. Thar’s a big stockade around it an’ armed men
are allus a-watchin’ for fear an outsider will git in. So that’s ther
place, eh? Wall, it will be hard to git Bessie out of Ranch V.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She shall be got out or I will give my life in the attempt!” cried a
tall, handsome young plainsman with flashing eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked much in earnest. Frank gazed at him critically. A
little later he was introduced to him as Walter Barrows, a rising
young stockman, and the lover of pretty Bessie Rodman.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>ON TO RANCH V.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Plans were quickly made.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was decided to work upon strategical grounds, as their force was
so much lighter than Cliff’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see, if we can strike Ranch V. at a time when Cliff and the
majority of his men are in the hills we can capture the place,” declared
Frank, shrewdly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s bizness,” agreed Harmon, “but ye’re the boss. I kin see
that ye’ve got a better head piece nor I have, Mister Reade.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will not admit that,” said Frank, modestly, “but rather let
us work together, Mr. Harmon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, cap’en. I’m with ye.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Further plans were elaborated, then as only a few hours yet intervened
until dawn, it was decided to snatch a few brief hours of sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the early dawn all were astir. The Vigilants saddled their
mustangs and all was soon ready for the start.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man was an object of great wonder to the plainsmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jinks!” exclaimed one of them, “the sight of that queer-lookin’
critter oughter scare the life out of any number of Injuns.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think the Steam Man will aid us much in accomplishing our
ends.” said Frank, modestly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The start was made just after daybreak. The Vigilants rode alongside
the Steam Man on their mustangs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course Frank was compelled to go more slowly on this account.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Vigilantes knew the way to Ranch V. and this was, after
all, the most important thing of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank considered it a great piece of luck in having fallen in with
the Vigilantes.</p>

<p class='c000'>He now understood exactly how matters stood all around.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was near noon when a halt was called in a small basin near a
lake of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here camp was briefly made, and also at the same time an important
discovery came to hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>A broad trail made by a cavalcade of men and horses was discovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>It pointed to the north.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harmon examined it carefully and finally, with great exuberance,
cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s good luck, friends. That thar trail I believe was made by ther
cowboys an’ it leads to ther hills. It’s over three days old, an’ they
haven’t come back this way. I should think that the most of their
men must be up there, in which case Ranch V. will be almost deserted.
Cum on, boys, let’s capture ther hull place.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With a cheer the Vigilants sprang to saddle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon they were once more galloping ever the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not two hours later, or in the middle of the afternoon, Harmon drew
his horse alongside the Steam Man and pointing to the south cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look yonder, Mr. Reade. Do ye see them lines of high ground?
Wall, jest this side ar ther Ranch V.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A cheer went up from all.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s Ranch Ours it’ll be, if iver we get there,” declared
Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, won’t dis be a big ‘sprise party fo’ dat vilyun Cliff,” cried
Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., held the Steam Man at a steady stride, and very
soon the ranch came in sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was truly a most extensive establishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stockade and buildings covered acres of ground. A great herd
of cattle were feeding on the open plains.</p>

<p class='c000'>The main ranch itself was surrounded by a high stockade, which
would resist most any ordinary attack with small arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Vigilants and the Steam Man came swiftly rushing down
upon the place, a great commotion was seen to take place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Men rushed out into the yards, horsemen went scurrying about,
and down came the stockade gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Harmon and his men rode boldly down to the gate, and began
to assail it with axes.</p>

<p class='c000'>While Frank Reade, Jr., kept the Steam Man on an elevation near,
from which he, with Barney and Pomp, covered the work of invasion
by a hot fire with their Winchesters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys could not get upon the stockade to fire at the assailants
for this reason.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harmon’s men therefore worked with perfect immunity.</p>

<p class='c000'>No more favorable time for an attack could have been chosen.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were but few of the cowboys in the ranch, and these were
picked off by the fire from the Steam Man as fast as they appeared on
the stockade.</p>

<p class='c000'>With lusty cries the vigilants chopped through the timbers of the
gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a remarkably brief time a hole was cut through and the gate
raised.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man rushed into the yard, and in less than ten minutes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>every cowboy in the place was a prisoner, and Ranch V. was captured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Walter Barrows, the brave young stockman, was the first to enter
the main ranch.</p>

<p class='c000'>The instinct of a lover took him to the chamber in which Bessie
Rodman was kept a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>He burst in the door and clasped the young girl in his arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>That was a joyous meeting.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they appeared in the yard the vigilants cheered wildly. It
was a brilliant victory.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ranch V. was captured.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stronghold of the outlaw Cliff, the den of villainy and vice,
was captured. It did not require much time for them to reach a decision
as to what to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Every building must be laid low!” cried Harmon. “Put the torch
to every accursed timber.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The cry was taken up and spread from lip to lip.</p>

<p class='c000'>In haste torches were procured. Harmon himself lit the first, and
was about to apply it to a building.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he did not do so.</p>

<p class='c000'>A thrilling incident stopped him. A loud cry went up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The cowboys! they are coming! To arms everybody! There
comes Cliff at their head!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Every eye was turned to the plain beyond the stockade.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no disputing the truth. Cliff and his gang returning
from the hills had come just in time.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be folly now to burn the ranch.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harmon, seeing the desperate exigency dropped the torch, and cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“To the stockade! It’s for life or death, boys. Fight to the last!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the command was not necessary. Already the brave Vigilants
were at their posts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cliff with his small army of followers came on at a swinging gallop.</p>

<p class='c000'>He could see that the ranch was in the possession of a foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>This inflamed his wrath, and, with loud curses and yells, he rode
down in the van of his followers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., had taken in the situation at a glance.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that it would be flatly impossible for the score of vigilants
to hold those three hundred desperadoes long at bay.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would mean the eventual massacre of every vigilant. This Frank
wished to avoid.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor had induced Bessie Rodman to seek refuge in
the wagon. Otherwise, she would certainly fall into the hands of the
foe again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank started the Steam Man ahead, and went down to the stockade.
He made the vigilantes a hasty address.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing will be gained by holding this place,” he declared, with
force. “You cannot do it. The odds are too great.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But we cannot surrender,” cried Harmon, “and how can we
retreat?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Easily enough,” replied Frank, “there is a rear gate. Open it
and cut out upon the prairie.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But they may overtake us?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is your only hope. You’ll have to work lively, for they are trying
to surround the stockade. I’ll cover your retreat easy enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Harmon saw that Frank was right.</p>

<p class='c000'>He did not pause to argue the point further. With quick commands
he caused his men to fall back.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stockade gate in the rear was opened just in time, and the vigilants
rushed out upon the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>They set out at a mad gallop for the distant hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys with mad cries followed. But they met with quite a
serious obstacle in their pursuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man kept exasperatingly between them and the vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the rear loop-holes of the wagon Barney and Pomp kept up a
steady fire with the Winchesters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly every shot emptied a saddle, and despite their superior numbers,
the cowboys soon found it better and safer to keep well out of
range.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pursuit lasted for ten miles. Then the horses of both parties
became fagged and they were compelled to halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Harmon’s men, by dint of careful work, got their horses into
the fastnesses of the hills. Here they felt more secure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man had well covered the retreat of the vigilants. But
darkness was now coming on and a serious question presented itself
to Frank Reade, Jr.</p>

<p class='c000'>To remain where they were for the night would be to incur the risk
of a midnight attack from the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>This might result seriously.</p>

<p class='c000'>At least Frank was disposed to evade it.</p>

<p class='c000'>He consulted with Harmon, and the result was an arrangement
which it was believed would be better for all.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the fastnesses of the hills Harmon felt sanguine of holding his
own against the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore it was decided that the Steam Man should leave the vicinity
and go far enough away over the prairie to make sure of safety
for the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly Frank left the vicinity and sent the Man striding over
the plain in the dusk of evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no visible indication that the cowboys intended to pursue.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had apparently gone into camp not five miles distant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank kept on with the Steam Man until twenty miles had been
covered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he came to a halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed as if they must feel safe here. Accordingly, arrangements
were made for passing the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>A comfortable seat was arranged for Bessie Rodman and, much exhausted
by the fatigue of her experiences, she quickly fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>But tears had wet her cheeks and trembled on her eyelashes. Frank
had told her of her father’s death.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I fear it is more than I can bear,” she declared, in agony of
spirit. “My dear, dear father. Oh, if I were a man, how I would
avenge him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are plenty to do that,” replied Frank, cheeringly. “The villain
shall surely pay for his evil deeds.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope it may come to pass,” she said, sincerely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she dropped off to sleep. But even as she slept, deadly peril
hung over her young and beautiful head.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>POMP’S MISTAKE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Frank Reade, Jr., felt comparatively safe as he rolled himself up
in a blanket and went to sleep. He did not believe that the villain,
Cliff, would be able to molest them that night.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Barney’s first watch.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hibernian, until midnight, kept a good lookout in the cage.
Then he called Pomp to succeed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky kept a good lookout until the early morning hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darkness was most intense.</p>

<p class='c000'>At about this time Pomp experienced a deadly faintness at the pit
of the stomach and a great longing for water.</p>

<p class='c000'>His thirst became most consuming, and it seemed as if he must, at
any cost, gratify it.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he found, upon looking in the tank, that it was empty.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was not a gill of cold water in the wagon. Pomp grew sober
with this dampening reflection.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I jes’ fink if I had a bit of watah I would be a’ right,” he muttered;
“but how ebber am dis niggah gwine fo’ to get it, dat’s what I’d
like to know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp went to the steel screen and tried to penetrate the darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that not ten yards distant were the waters of a small
creek. He could hear them rippling now.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was directly at variance with his orders to open the cage door.
Yet it seemed to Pomp as if he must do so.</p>

<p class='c000'>The risk did not seem great.</p>

<p class='c000'>There seemed little likelihood of the proximity of a foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp felt certain that he could reach the creek, get his drink, and
get back safely to the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was sorely tempted. The desire was most powerful.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly!” he muttered, with a wry face. “What am I gwine fo’ to
do? I don’ beliebe dar’s any danger ob going out dar, but if Marse
Frank knew it he’d fix me putty quick. Sakes alibe! but what am a
chile gwine fo’ to do? I am mos’ dyin’ fo’ a drink ob watah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp thought of awakening Barney and enlisting his aid.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he reflected that the Celt would be certain to disagree with his
scheme.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no other way but to assume the responsibility himself.
Pomp drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he fell to listening.</p>

<p class='c000'>All was silent as the grave.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sho!” he muttered. “Dar ain’t no danger at all. I’ll jest hab
dat watah as suah as I’m born.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He quickly slid back the bolt in the door and opened it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he stepped out of the wagon. In another moment he glided
down to the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp flung himself flat and began to drink of the creek water.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he had not taken one drink when he became aware of an appalling
sensation. He turned his head and glanced back at the Steam
Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lantern hanging in the cage showed the open door and all as
plain as day. But, great heavens! What did he see?</p>

<p class='c000'>Dark forms were swarming about the machine. One was already in
the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp saw this much, and then his attention was claimed by another
matter. He suddenly felt a heavy body descend upon him and talon
fingers clutched his throat.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that flash of time Pomp had turned partly over.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was just in time to see the flash of a knife blade. He made a
convulsive upward blow, and grasped the wrist of his unknown assailant.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the merest chance the death blow had been averted.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was a close call.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then with a herculean effort Pomp rolled over the edge of the bank,
and the next moment, with a powerful swing, he had brought himself
and assailant into the water of the creek.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sudden bath caused Pomp’s adversary to relax his grip.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky had no further motive for continuing the struggle,
and striking out swam for the opposite bank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He clambered out of the water, and crawled into a thicket.</p>

<p class='c000'>There he lay shivering, and witnessed a thrilling scene upon the
other bank of the creek.</p>

<p class='c000'>The occupants of the wagon had all been aroused, and were every
one prisoners, in the power of Cliff and his cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>The outlaw had managed to cover the twenty miles, skillfully following
the trail by means of a dark lantern.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had been hovering with his minions about the Steam Man, just
as Pomp committed the indiscretion of leaving the door open.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Of course it was an easy matter for the cowboys to board the wagon
and make prisoners of all on board.</p>

<p class='c000'>The glee of Cliff was beyond expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>He danced and clapped his hands with fiendish joy. He pinched
Bessie’s arms until she screamed with agony, and with brutal laughter
roared:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I’ll make ye all dance. Ye thought ye’d git away from me,
did ye, gal? I’ll show ye that ye can’t get away from Artemas Cliff.
Ha, ha, ha! What a good joke.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He laughed uproariously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All mine,” he continued, “And this Steam Man, this wonderful
invention, is just what I want. I can travel around in great style.
Oh, Mr. Frank Reade, Jr., I’ll dance on your grave yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Monster!” cried Frank, writhing in his bonds. “You’ll never
succeed. A righteous God will never permit it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The villain gave his men <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</span> to make camp and indulge
in a carousal.</p>

<p class='c000'>They did so until daybreak, and then Cliff stated that it was his
purpose to go back to Ranch V.</p>

<p class='c000'>It did not lake him long to understand the mechanism of the Steam
Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>He quickly found out how to use the throttle reins. He was aided
by the fact that he had once been a locomotive engineer.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the early morning light the start for Ranch V. was made.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Pomp, wet and shivering and horrified, crouched in the thicket
upon the bank of the creek, saw the Steam Man and his friends, all
in the power of the foe, take departure.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had gone Pomp came out of his hiding-place.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly!” he muttered, with distended eyeballs, “I jes’ fink dis nigger
hab done de berry awfulest fing eber known. Dar am only one
way fo’ Pomp to sabe his honor, an’ dat am to fix some way to rescue
Marse Frank an’ all ob de odders, an’ I’ll do it if I can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp was very much in earnest.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was a brave and generous fellow, and willing at any time to sacrifice
his life for his master.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some manner he must certainly vindicate himself. He crossed
the creek again and stood upon the spot where the Steam Man had
been.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course the machine was out of sight by this time, but nevertheless,
Pomp took the trail and proceeded to follow it.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some hours he trudged on over the prairie. All the while the
darky was revolving in his mind some plan for the relief of his friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was bound to admit that it was a puzzle. Yet he did not lose
hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hills were every moment becoming plainer. Already Pomp had
covered five of the twenty miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky was a good walker, and no distance was too great for his
trained muscles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sun was beginning to run high in the heavens, and a brisk
breeze blew across the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp kept on steadily.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trail kept on toward the hills, and the sagacious darky reflected
that Cliff was likely going to join the main body of his men.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I jes’ fink I can see what dat rascal am up to,” muttered Pomp.
“He am jus’ too sharp to let de game slip him once he gits his clutches
onto it. He am jus’ goin’ fo’ to take de Steam Man to his Ranch V.,
and dar’s whar dis darky must go an’ try fo’ to work some leetle plan
fo’ to rescue Frank Reade, Jr., an’ de odders. Dat am a fac’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With this logical conclusion Pomp trudged on.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was now on the last five miles of his journey to the hills. The
sun was long past the noon hour when Pomp, by dint of rapid walking,
had made the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no sign visible of the Steam Man or of the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Pomp saw that the trail continued around the base of the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>This puzzled the darkey a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused and scratched his head in deep thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat am a dretful queer thing,” he muttered. “Dat ain’t de way
to go to Ranch V, if I’se right in mah conjeckshun.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he paused, and a light of comprehension broke across his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>A distant sound had come to his hearing. It was the faint rattle of
firearms far up in the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly!” he ejaculated. “I see de trick ob dat berry sharp fox,
Artemus Cliff. He am gwine fo’ to gib de Vigilants a good lickin’
afore he goes to Ranch V. Dat am jus’ my bes’ way for to jine Marse
Harmon an’ his men, an’ help dem trash the cowboys.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp’s mind was made up.</p>

<p class='c000'>He would join the vigilants and do his best to give the cowboys a
good drubbing. He at once struck into the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>But alas for Pomp!</p>

<p class='c000'>Luck seemed against the darky for the time being. He had not
more than fairly entered a narrow pass when an appalling incident
occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>The air was suddenly broken by wild yells, and in an instant he was
surrounded by half a hundred painted savages, who burst from niches
and crevices in the rocks about.</p>

<p class='c000'>They pounced upon him, and before Pomp had even time to think
of resistance he was a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The savages swarmed about him like bees. Words cannot express
Pump’s dismay at this turn.</p>

<p class='c000'>His eyes bulged, and his knees shook as with the ague.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ de good Lor’ dis am dretful!” he groaned. “I’se done fo’ dis
time, an’ dar am nobody to rescue Marse Frank!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>It was truly a dubious outlook. The savages were of Black Buffalo’s
gang of Sioux, and they seemed much elated at getting the prisoner
once more into their clutches.</p>

<p class='c000'>They chattered and gesticulated like a flock of magpies, and some
of them approached Pomp with their tomahawks as though they would
fain make an end of him then and there.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the others held them back and an excited wrangle followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this while Pomp was writhing in his bonds. In vain he tried to
break them.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some while the savages wrangled. Then a compromise was
made and Pomp was picked up bodily, and carried through the pass
and into a small glade among some trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here he was tied to a tree and a great heap of fagots were piled at
his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a chill of horror, the darky saw that the savages meant to
take his life in a horrible manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was to suffer death in the flames. Pomp felt sick and faint.
But even in that moment he thought not of himself, brave fellow, but
of Frank Reade, Jr., and the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly sakes, whoebber am gwine fo’ to sabe Marse Frank, now?”
he groaned.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>IN THE ENEMY’S POWER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Artemus Cliff shouted in evil glee and triumph as he manipulated
the Steam Man and let him out for a swift run across the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>He amused himself by racing with his followers who were on horseback.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By jingo!” he roared, “this is more fun than I ever had before.
Why this beats the steam-cars all to smash. And it’s all mine. Why
I can travel like a prince now. Ha-ha-ha! I’m the luckiest man on
earth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned and fixed a glowering gaze upon Bessie Rodman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And ye’re mine too,” he cried, “the lily of the prairie. The happy
life companion of Artemus Cliff. When I get my hands onto Uncle
Jim Travers’ millions, we’ll travel the world over, my daisy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Bessie did not appear to heed his words, though her face increased
a trifle in its pallor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Monster!” cried Frank Reade, Jr., with intensity. “You will
never succeed. Heaven will not permit it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heaven don’t have much to do with me,” cried the villain, with
a lurid oath. “The devil has been a good friend of mine, and I ain’t
afraid of his place either.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, they wudn’t have ye even there,” cried Barney. “Yez
are too wicked for avin that place.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, ho, Irish, you’ve got your tongue, eh?” cried Cliff, with a
vicious laugh. “So ye think I’m too bad, eh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be me sowl, thar cudn’t be a place too bad for yez!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll have a nice little hades fixed fer yer right on this earth an’
I’ll give ye a fair taste of it in advance, too,” said the villain, vengefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Arrah, yez can’t scare me at all, at all,” he retorted. “Yer
threats are jist the same as a puppy dog’s bark.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll find that I’m the kind of a dog that bites,” averred the
villain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s not me that cares fer yer bites.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll see about that. Don’t blow your horn too soon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, that’s good advice fer yersilf, ye blatherskite! Av I
on’y had me two hands to use now I’d baste the rascality out av yez
or I’d make a good job fer ther undhertaker.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Talk is cheap,” sneered the villain. “Ye’d better save yer
wind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s yersilf as nades it most,” said Barney, bound to have the last
word.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cliff evidently found Barney’s tongue equal to his own, for he abandoned
the conversation in a sullen fashion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bessie Rodman made no attempt at speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>She sat silently in one corner of the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., also remained silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The twenty miles were quickly covered by the Steam Man. It was
yet far from the noon hour when they arrived at the camp of the previous
night.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys in full force were there, and as Cliff appeared with the
Steam Man, they made the welkin ring with yells of delight and satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>All crowded around to examine the steam wonder and inspect its
mechanism.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoners looked out upon a sea of faces. They were not kindly
regarded by the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take ‘em out and shoot ‘em, Cliff!” cried a voice in the crowd.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give ‘em twenty paces and a grave seven feet deep.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Cliff refused to do this.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Leave it to me!” he cried. “I’ve got a better plan.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?” was the cry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want ye all to be ready in half an hour to go into the hills an’
corner Harmon an’ his gang. There must not one of the vigilants
go out of here alive.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah!” yelled the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can give them the worst thrashin’ they ever had.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of<a id='t11'></a> course we can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In regard to these prisoners, the gal is going to be my wife. The
others I’m going to have some fun with down to the ranch. We’ll
have a rabbit chase with ‘em, or something of the kind.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“Good!” yelled the mob, carried away with the plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus the fate of the prisoners was decided by their captors. But
the question of attack upon the vigilants was now the one in order.</p>

<p class='c000'>Preparations were at once made for cornering Harmon and his heroic
little band.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several parties of cowboys were dispatched to head off any possible
attempt at escape from the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harmon’s men were certainly hemmed in on all sides, and it was a
most dubious outlook for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The exultation of the cowboys was beyond expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ve got ‘em dead sure!” cried Cliff, triumphantly. “Not a one
on ‘em can possibly escape.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys now began to close the line in about their prey.</p>

<p class='c000'>A pass was found through which the Steam Man was taken, and to
a point within easy range of the position held by the Vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harmon had chosen an elevated position on a kind of small tableland
or plateau.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here behind bowlders he had concentrated his forces. The position
was not a bad one to defend.</p>

<p class='c000'>To charge upon it the cowboys would have to ascend a height of
fifty feet or more in the face of a strong fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this sacrifice of men Cliff did not intend to make, at least not
at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were other points of vantage about, which the cowboys quickly
took possession of.</p>

<p class='c000'>From these a desultory fire was kept up with the Vigilants with
some loss upon both sides.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Harmon’s men could not very well withstand any loss whatever.
This the cowboys could stand better.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man, however, could advance to very close proximity
with the Vigilants, and those on board were safe from any shots of
retaliation.</p>

<p class='c000'>This made it bad for Harmon for he had no way of checking this
most destructive fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a most galling thing for Frank Reade, Jr., to remain idle and
see his invention used in such a manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>He groaned aloud with horror and dismay. Barney did the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, if I could only free myself,” declared the young inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, I wish I cud do that same,” muttered Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cliff and the three cowboys with him in the cage were doing their
best to shoot every Vigilant who exposed himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were thus so deeply engrossed that they paid no special heed
to the prisoners for the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney, quick-witted Irishman, noted this fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a favorable moment he leaned over and whispered to Frank:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, Misther Frank, I think I know av a way to turn the
tables on them blasted omadhouns.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The deuce!” gasped Frank. “What is it, Barney?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whisht now an’ work quiet, me gossoon!” whispered Barney.
“I’ll lay down ferninst the side here an’ yez kin turn yer wrists toward
me mouth an’ me teeth are no good av I don’t cut them in two
before so very long.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank experienced a thrill.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you do it, Barney?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Av course I kin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But if they see us——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They’ll niver do that. Be aisy now, me gossoon, an’ roight on
the shelf there there’s a knoife an’ yez kin cut my bonds at the same
toime. Thin we kin take care av ther four av thim. I’ll take two
mesilf.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I’m good for the other two or I’ll die!” muttered Frank.
“All right, Barney, do your best.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But at this moment Bessie Rodman leaned forward, and in a soft
whisper said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait! There is a quicker way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Barney were astonished.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What?” exclaimed the young inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>By way of reply Bessie drew both hands from behind her.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were free. There were livid lines upon the fair wrists, where
the cruel throngs had cut in.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the shapely hands were so small that Bessie had been enabled
to slip them through the bonds and free them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up to this moment neither Frank nor Barney had looked upon the
young girl as more than the ordinary weak woman.</p>

<p class='c000'>That is to say, they had not given her credit for the amount of nerve
she possessed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they were given ample evidence of it now.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quick as a flash, and with commendable resolution, she reached
over and seized the knife upon the shelf.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was but a moment’s work for her to cut Frank’s bonds. As they
snapped, the young Inventor took the knife and quickly cut Barney’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their captors were at the loop-holes firing, and had not seen this
move.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing could have worked better.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank picked up a club, and Barney an iron bar. Nobody can
handle a weapon of the sort better than an Irishman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whurroo! bad cess to yez fer a pack av omadhouns,” cried Barney,
dealing one of the cowboys a crushing blow on the head.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before one could think, the iron bar came down upon the head
of another. Both sank senseless to the floor of the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., had knocked Cliff senseless. Only one of the
foe was left, and he was quickly knocked out.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a twinkling, as it were, the tables were turned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Frank Reade, Jr., were now masters of the Steam Man
once more. The irrepressible Irishman pulled the whistle valve and
sent up a shriek of defiance and triumph.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank Reade, Jr., swung open the wagon door.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Throw them out!” he cried; “all but Cliff.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney obeyed the command. The three cowboys were quickly
dumped out upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Cliff was allowed to remain. The villain lay insensible in the
bottom of the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was about to bind him, when an imminent peril claiming his
immediate attention prevented him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys were aware of the turning of the tables in the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>With mad yells they were rushing forward in a body to surround
the Steam Man. Unless immediate action was made they would succeed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank knew well the danger of this move.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be an easy matter for the cowboys to ruin the invention by
a single blow. There was but one way, and that was to beat a retreat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney seized his repeater and began firing into the crowd of cowboys.
Frank opened the throttle and sent the Steam Man up the incline
toward the stronghold of the vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course the latter had seen and understood all.</p>

<p class='c000'>They embraced the opportunity to pour a flank fire into the ranks of
the cowboys. It was a moment of thrilling sort, but the Steam Man
seemed to have the best of it when a thrilling incident happened.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>WITH THE VIGILANTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In another moment the Steam Man would have been in the ranks
of the vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would have been a great point scored, for Cliff would then be a
prisoner and the way to save Jim Travers from the gallows would
have been paved.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was not to be.</p>

<p class='c000'>The villain had come to in the meanwhile, but cunning rascal that
he was, had laid inanimate in the bottom of the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had seen all that was going on, and when he saw that the Steam
Man was certain to escape he knew that only desperate action upon
his part would save him now.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly while Frank and Barney were occupied at their posts,
he made a sudden lightning leap for the door in the cage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unfortunately Barney had not fastened it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little scream of warning came from Bessie, but it was too late.</p>

<p class='c000'>The villain flung open the door and sprung out.</p>

<p class='c000'>He tumbled heels over head down the decline.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was partly done on purpose to avoid any bullets sent after him.
But none struck him, and he was the next moment in the ranks of
his men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank turned just in time to see the daring escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor’s disappointment was so great that he came
near leaving the wagon to pursue the villain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, av ther divil ain’t got clane away entoirely!” cried Barney
in dismay.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m sorry,” returned Frank. “But take the precaution now,
Barney, to bolt that door.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney complied with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he was obliged to return to his post, for the enemy were thick
in the rear.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the next moment the Steam Man topped the rise.</p>

<p class='c000'>A volley from the Vigilants drove the cowboys back for the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank Reade, Jr., brought the machine to a halt upon the
plateau.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Vigilants were wild with delight, and crowded about the Steam
Man. Frank Reade, Jr., opened the door and descended among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an instant Harmon was by his side and had gripped his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“God bless ye, Mr. Reade!” cried the whole-souled plainsman.
“It’s like takin’ the paw of one brought back from the dead. Dogdast
it, but I’d given ye up entirely when I see that your Steam Man
was in the hands or that coyote. It’s all like a kind of miracle.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think we may congratulate ourselves,” said Frank, “but do you
know that we are in a tight box?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nobody knows it better,” declared Harmon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I doubt if we pull out of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What kin we do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is there no avenue open for retreat?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not a one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then we can only stay here and fight to the last. Of course I
might be able to elude them with the Steam Man, but I’d never try
that while any of your band are left.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“P’raps it would be ther best way.” said Harmon, generously.
“At least you could save the gal. It don’t matter so much about us.
We’re only rough men, and not a one of us afeared to die.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are heroes!” cried Frank, with fervor, “and if I should desert
you, I would forswear my honor as a man. No, the Steam Man,
will stay here and fight for you until the last, depend on it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In course we need your help,” replied Harmon. “Mebbe we’ll
whip ther skunks yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll try it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, that we will,” cried Barney. “Whurroo! av’ I only had
a good whack at that baste av’ a Cliff now I’d sphoil his beauty
foriver.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Walter Barrows and Bessie had been holding a joyful conference.
But now the order went up:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Every man to his post. The enemy are coming.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There were no delinquents. Not one in that heroic little band hung
back.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was true that the foe were coming again to the attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>With Cliff leading them they were charging furiously up the hill.
But the Vigilants stood firm and gave them a raking volley.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment they wavered. Then once more they came on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cliff’s voice could be heard as he rallied them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Curse ye, go on up thar and kill the hull crew of ‘em!” he
yelled. “Don’t let one of them escape alive! Kill ‘em, every one,
and don’t give any quarter!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll see about that,” muttered Frank Reade, Jr. “It may
not be so easy to do all that, Mr. Cliff.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Barney, from their position aboard the Steam Man,
could pour a terrible fire into the ranks of the foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a terrible battle!</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys were mowed down like grain before the sickle; yet
they did not waver, but came on faster.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every moment they drew nearer the top of the rise. If they surrounded
it the sequel would be brief.</p>

<p class='c000'>Overpowering muscles would quickly tell the story, and the little
band of vigilants would be wiped out of existence.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was, without doubt, Cliff’s purpose to give no quarter. A wholesale
massacre would be the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Vigilants were now fighting for their lives. As well die facing
the foe as with back turned. Every man was resolute in this.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the tremendous body of men swept over the rise and gained the
plateau. In a twinkling the Vigilants were surrounded, and it seemed
as if no power would intervene to save them from sure and total extinction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., took in the situation at a glance, and cried despairingly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney, we are lost! Our end has come, and we are as good as
dead men already!”</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>Poor Pomp saw no way out of the awful situation in which he was
placed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Death in its most awful form was upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'>A worse fate could not be imagined.</p>

<p class='c000'>The savages piled the brushwood about him, and danced with
demoniac yells about the pile.</p>

<p class='c000'>If Pomp could have turned pale, he would have been whiter than
chalk at that moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>But for all this, the darky’s fears were even now more for his friends
than for himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly Massy!” he chattered, shivering like one with the ague.
“Whatebber will be de end ob all dis. Yere Ise gwine fo’ to be
burned to death, and Marse Frank in de clutches ob dat rascal Cliff,
an’ nobody to rescue him. Oh, good Lor’ it am dretful.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was indeed a dreadful thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Pomp was certainly powerless. Higher the brushwood was
heaped, and then one of the savages advanced with a torch.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment he had applied it to the pile.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dry wood burned like tinder. In an instant great flames sprang
up.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they were at the edge of the pile. However, Pomp felt their
heat and they would soon reach him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The poor darky was nearly insane with a frenzy of desperation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The savages now began a fiendish dance about the pile. They
leaped and ran, and swung their tomahawks and made hideous faces
at their victim.</p>

<p class='c000'>But fate had not ordained that this was to be Pomp’s end.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even while death seemed certain, rescue was close at hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly there smote upon the air the ring of horses’ hoofs, and a
quick sharp order, followed by the crash of carbines.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indians fell in heaps before that volley. A panic resulted and the
next moment through the smoke Pomp saw the gleam of uniforms,
and knew that a body of United States cavalry had happened upon
the spot just in the nick of time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky was beside himself with the realization.</p>

<p class='c000'>He tried to break his bonds, and cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sabe me, sogers—sabe Pomp! He am gwine fo’ suah to burn to
death ef yo’ don’ sabe him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the call was not necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through the smoke sprang two dismounted soldiers. In a twinkling
the burning brush was kicked aside, and Pomp’s bonds were cut.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the darky was face to face with a tall, handsome young
officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians had been dispersed and the fight was over.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am Col. Clark, of the United States Seventh Cavalry,” said the
young officer. “Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am Pomp!” was the darky’s prompt reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>The officer smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, who do you belong to?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I belongs to Marse Frank Reade, Jr.,” replied Pomp, with emphasis.
“I’se a free nigger, but I goes wherebber Marse Frank goes
jest de same.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I see,” replied the officer; “well, where is your master just
now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, for goodness!” cried Pomp, excitedly. “He am in a heap
ob trubble, an’ yo’ kin help him out of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With this Pomp told Clark all about the Steam Man and their mission
in the West.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young colonel listened with deep interest, and then when apprised
of the fact that the Steam Man and its passengers were in the
hands of Cliff, he cried, excitedly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jupiter! that man Cliff is just the chap I am after. Word
was brought to the fort some time ago of a den of thieves up here with
a rendezvous called Ranch V. Do you know of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly sakes, Marse colonel,” cried Pomp, excitedly, “yo’ kin jest
bet I does! Jes’ yo’ find de cowboys and rescue Marse Frank and he
done show yo’ where de Ranch V. are.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It shall be done if we are able,” said Colonel Clark.</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned to his men who were scattered about the vicinity, having
been engaged in driving the savages out of the valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the bugle quickly recalled them.</p>

<p class='c000'>A spare horse was brought forward for Pomp and then the cavalrymen
in solid body rode out of the valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they struck the prairie below, the distant sounds of firing came
to their ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the din of the conflict between the Vigilants and the cowboys.
Aided by the sounds Colonel Clark was able to gallop straight
to the scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through a pass in the hills they reached the plateau. They burst
upon the cowboys in the rear just at the critical moment when it
seemed as if Harmon’s heroic little band was doomed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It required but a glance for Clark to take in the situation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whirling his sabre aloft he spurred his horse forward with the thrilling
command:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Forward! Charge!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FORTUNES OF WAR.</span></h2>

<p class='c010'>Just at that moment when utter destruction threatened the brave
little band of vigilants the U. S. soldiers came upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing could have been more opportune.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the saving of the day. The emotions of all at sight of the
glittering uniforms may be imagined.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great shout of triumph went up. A yell of dismay came from
the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then followed the rattling of steel and the flash of sabre blades.
Before that charge what force could stand?</p>

<p class='c000'>Backward the followers of Artemus Cliff were forced.</p>

<p class='c000'>In vain the villain tried to rally them. They would not respond.</p>

<p class='c000'>The odds were too great and they broke and fled in wild confusion.
The next moment Pomp dashed up the incline and dropped
from his horse almost at Frank Reade, Jr’s, feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bress de Lor’, Marse Frank,” he cried ecstatically. “Yo’ am
alibe an’ well, an’ dis nigger hab brought yo’ a rescue aftah all.
P’raps yo’ forgib me fo’ leabin’ de Steam Man when I hadn’t ought?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are forgiven, Pomp!” cried Frank, lightly. “I might have
done the same thing myself. I am glad no harm came to you. I had
given you up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Deed no, Marse Frank!” cried the delighted darky. “I is too
bad fo’ to die. Hi dar, Pish, I is glad to see you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, if it ain’t the naygur!” cried Barney, with a wild rush at
Pomp. “Whurroo, it’s glad I am to see yez onct more alive an’ well!
Bejabers that’s so!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The two friends embraced warmly. Then Colonel Clark rode up
and saluted all.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It seems that you’ve been having a bit of a squall here,” he declared,
“but at any rate you’ve vanquished the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“With your timely assistance,” replied Frank. “But I believe we
are not strangers, colonel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Frank Reade, Jr., the inventor!” cried Clark, springing from the
saddle and seizing Frank’s hand. “Well, now, I’m glad to see you.
But come to think of it, your colored man mentioned the name of
Frank Reade, but I never dreamed that it was you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is nobody else,” replied Frank with a laugh. “And I well remember
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I do you,” replied Clark. “I was once one of an army commission
to visit you and make you an offer for one of your inventions
on a gun.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You would not sell it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” replied Frank. “I do not care to sell any of my inventions.
They are for my own use. I will always, however, put them at the
disposal of the weak and oppressed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Truly a noble sentiment,” agreed the colonel, “but I am anxious
to capture this man Cliff. Hello! what have you there? A giant in
iron? One of your new inventions is it? Well, that beats all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With this Clark proceeded to make an inspection of the Steam Man.
A great crowd of the newcomers were doing the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an object of great wonderment. Frank showed its working
to the entertainment of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Cliff’s men had not been so easily beaten as the savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had dispersed into the passes and were somewhat scattered,
but here they made a stand and resisted stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was necessary to dislodge them as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>At any moment they might avail themselves of the fortunes of war
and turn victory into defeat.</p>

<p class='c000'>So Clark quickly called his men together.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only a brief rest was all that he would accord them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bugle sounded “boots and saddles,” and every man was
quickly mounted.</p>

<p class='c000'>A plan was quickly outlined between Frank Reade, Jr., and Col.
Clark.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>This was that the cavalry should pursue and thoroughly rout the
cowboys, even going down to Ranch V to effect its destruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vigilants were to return home, and the cavalry would see to the
punishment of Artemas Cliff.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Steam Man was to remain at a point below until the return
of the cavalry.</p>

<p class='c000'>If possible Cliff was to be captured alive and a confession wrung
from his lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>This plan had been agreed upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vigilants were not wholly satisfied, yet did not demur.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clark and his command dashed away into the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vigilants and the Steam Man started for the open prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>This division of forces very soon proved to be an unwise and unfortunate
thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fortunes of war are proverbial for changes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strongly intrenched in the hills, Cliff’s gang gave the soldiers a
disastrous battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>In vain the plucky young colonel tried to dislodge them.</p>

<p class='c000'>They fought like tigers, and having the advantage of location, actually
decimated the cavalry one half in number.</p>

<p class='c000'>Until nightfall, Col. Clark kept persistently waging the battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he began to think of retreat.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, to his horror, he found that this was by no means as easy a
matter as he had fancied.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foe had actually closed in upon him, and nearly every avenue
of retreat was closed.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was literally surrounded by the foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My soul!” he muttered, in deep surprise; “this is not very good
generalship on my part.”</p>

<p class='c000'>What was to be done?</p>

<p class='c000'>It was plainly impossible to dislodge the foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The little band of cavalrymen were now hardly adequate to cope
with the foe in their front.</p>

<p class='c000'>It really seemed as if Cliff had received reinforcements. The
number of his band had in some mysterious manner been increased.</p>

<p class='c000'>Darkness was coming on rapidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Something must be done, and at once. Col. Clark racked his brain
for an expedient.</p>

<p class='c000'>Certainly they must extricate themselves from this position, and
without delay. Men were falling every moment about them, and the
enemy’s line, like a cordon of death, was every moment drawing
tighter about them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cold sweat broke out upon the intrepid colonel’s brow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My God!” he muttered. “What is to be done?”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a terrible question. They were literally in a trap of death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cliff was aware of this, and his men made the air hideous with their
yells. Closer they crowded the line.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this extremity Clark regretted having separated himself from the
Vigilants and the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this error had been made, and it was too late to correct it.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the brave colonel was not long without an expedient.</p>

<p class='c000'>He called out one of his pluckiest privates, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jason, do you want to undertake a ticklish job?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’m ready, sir,” replied the private, with a salute.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You know we are in a tight box?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must have reinforcements or the enemy will surely get the
best of us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It looks that way, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, I want you to try to get through the enemy’s line. Look
for the Vigilants and the Steam Man and tell them to come to our
aid. Then ride to the fort as fast as you can for a fresh squad. Tell
the officer in charge to send two hundred mounted men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think you can do this?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will do it or I will not come back.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clark knew that Jason meant just what he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few moments later the courier for relief slipped carefully into the
shadows and was gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>A prayer trembled on Clark’s lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t care for myself,” he muttered, “but I cannot bear to see
my brave boys slaughtered like sheep.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Darkness now thickly settled down. Of course no fighting could be
done until the break of day.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the cavalrymen were not in a position to guarantee them much
rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Few of them dared to sleep, and then it was upon their arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the night hours dragged by, Clark paced the ground upon the
outskirts of the camp and listened for some sign of the return of Jason.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that it was not possible for the faithful courier to return
from the fort under two days.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if the cavalry division was reinforced by the Vigilants and the
Steam Man they might be able to keep the foe at bay until the fresh
squad should arrive.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus the plucky young colonel clung to hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Time passed. It seemed an age to Clark before a silent shadowy
form slipped out of the gloom and into the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it drew nearer he recognized the courier Jason.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, my man!” he said, sharply. “You are back.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Jason saluted quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are the reinforcements?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I did not find them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But—did I not tell you to find them?” began the colonel, angrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Easy, colonel,” said Jason, respectfully. “I think I have done a
better thing, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s a good ways to the fort. You might be cut to pieces before I
could return. I have found an avenue by which I think we can escape.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clark’s manner changed instantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You don’t mean it?” he exclaimed, excitedly. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Jason drew nearer and lowered his voice in a mysterious manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just over that pile of bowlders,” he whispered, “I found a narrow
passage through the mountain side. It is almost a cavern,
for the top is so closely overhung with bushes. It’s a close squeeze
for the horses, but I think we can all get through and out upon the
prairie before daybreak.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Col. Clark was intensely excited.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good for you, Jason!” he cried, in a joyful manner. “Arouse
the camp, but do it quietly. Put every man in his saddle within
ten minutes. You have solved our salvation, and you shall be promoted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Jason hurried away to do the bidding of the colonel.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a brief space of time the camp was aroused.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weary soldiers, worn out with fighting, were only too glad to
learn of the possibility of an escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>At once preparations were made to steal a march upon the enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The passage described by Jason was found. It was necessary to
first pry aside a huge bowlder before passage could be made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Into the passage the little band went, and one by one filed out
into the valley beyond.</p>

<p class='c000'>So skillfully was the move executed that the foe never dreamed
of it. Daybreak came, and Cliff was furious to find that his intended
victims had given him the slip during the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cavalrymen had reached the prairie in safety, and galloped
away from the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clark knew that his only and best move now was to return to the
fort for reinforcements.</p>

<p class='c000'>He could not hope to do anything with the foe with such a mere
handful of men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly, just as the sun appeared above the horizon, the little
cavalcade, with its shattered ranks, galloped away across the plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>No effort was made to search for the Vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clark knew that even with their aid it would not be feasible to give
battle to the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clearly it was necessary to have two hundred more men. The
colonel set his lips vengefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will teach that desperado a lesson,” he muttered. “He shall be
swept out of existence together with his rascally crew, and before another
week.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On over the prairie they galloped toward the fort.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as they rode, thrilling adventures were the lot of Frank Reade,
Jr., and his friends on board the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us, therefore, for a time, deviate here and follow their fortunes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ABDUCTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Chief Harmon of the Vigilants was not wholly content to abandon
the trail of the cowboys, just here.</p>

<p class='c000'>He indulged in quite an argument with Frank Reade, Jr.</p>

<p class='c000'>His remarks were not without logic.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, only look at the sense of the thing,” he declared, “It is by
no means possible that the soldiers are going to have an easy time
with Cliff and his men. They may turn the tables on them yet. I tell
you it was a premature thing for that colonel to do, to set us adrift so
quickly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet he ought to know his own strength,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t believe he does.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot but feel that he is doing the right thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t feel that way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, in case of defeat the stigma will not fall upon you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, but that is not the idea. We must not let Cliff defeat them.
If he does, he will defeat us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you propose?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am not going back home yet. We will make a camp down here
on Willow Creek. When we learn for a fact that Cliff has been done
up, then we will go home. Until then we are on duty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw that Harmon was right. He extended his hand and
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I agree with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I knew ye would,” replied the Vigilant leader. “We can do this
upon our own responsibility. You are to wait for Clark at a point
below here, I believe?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very good. That point is on Willow Creek. We will accompany
you there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was nightfall before Willow Creek was reached.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a convenient spot camp was made. The darkness became most
intense in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Camp-fires were made and guards posted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fires in the furnace of the Steam Man were banked, and the occupants
descended and mixed with the Vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men gathered around the fires, and told stories and cracked
jokes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Walter Barrows, the young Vigilant who was so deeply in love with
Bessie Rodman, had waited upon her at the wagon step, and together
they took a lover-like walk down the bank of the creek.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Nobody saw them go, and it is doubtful if any one would have
sought to restrain them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they were committing unwittingly an act of great risk and folly.</p>

<p class='c000'>For unknown to any in the camp a coterie of dusky savages lurked
in the tall prairie grass about.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp were entertaining the camp with some of their
Munchhausen stories.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plainsmen roared with laughter until their sides ached.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both were comical mokes and were continually playing roots upon
each other. Barney had just worked a gag upon Pomp when suddenly
the distant crack of a pistol was heard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly every man in the camp was upon his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most intense of excitement reigned. All was confusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then one of the guards came rushing in.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s a hull lot of Apaches down yonder,” he cried, “ther grass
is full of ‘em and I reckon they’ve surrounded the camp.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Steady all!” thundered Harmon, the Vigilant leader. “Who fired
that pistol shot?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know,” replied the guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is anybody outside the line?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Walter Barrows and the young lady passed me not an hour ago.
They went on down the creek.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My soul!” gasped Harmon, with white face, “that was Barrows
pistol without doubt. He an’ the gal have certainly fallen into the
grip of ther Injuns. We must make lively work to save ‘em.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., had listened to this report with a sensation of horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp had at once desisted in their fun-making, and
Barney proceeded to open the Steam Man’s furnace.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crack of rifles now sounded all around the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The savages, without doubt, were drawing their line closer, and
meant if possible to exterminate the little band of Vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>But a line of defense was then thrown out, and the skulking savages
were held at bay.</p>

<p class='c000'>But a desultory and very unsatisfactory species of warfare was kept
up in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was impossible to tell how to move or where.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enemy fired from all directions and practically at random.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the Vigilants were wounded, and Captain Harmon was
angry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Confound an Injun!” he muttered, in disgust. “They have sich a
sneakin’ way of fighting. They allus attack one after dark, an’ hain’t
got the pluck to come out in the open an’ fight.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Everybody was bound to acknowledge the logic of this.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the savages kept up the same mode of attack until Frank Reade,
Jr., made a diversion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney had succeeded in getting up steam once more in the Steam
Man, and now Frank Reade, Jr., approached Harmon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Give me five men,” he declared, “and I will whip the foe for
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Five men!” gasped Harmon. “Why, they’re ten to one out
there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t care if they are.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you give me the men?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh yes, but——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s no time for questions, Captain Harmon. Leave it all to
me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, Mr. Reade.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By Harmon’s orders five of The Vigilants joined Frank Reade.</p>

<p class='c000'>He led them aboard the steam wagon. Then he closed the door
and seized the reins which connected with the throttle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man gave a shriek loud enough to perforate the ear
drums of any one in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then it dashed out upon the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effect may be imagined.</p>

<p class='c000'>The monster with fiery eyes and all flame and smoke, with clanking
thunderous tread plunging into the midst of the foe, was an apparition
well to be feared.</p>

<p class='c000'>Right into the midst of the savages the Steam Man ran.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the armed men in the screened wagon poured destructive
volleys into the midst of the red foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pen cannot adequately describe the situation.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment the Apaches held their ground. Then, with wild,
baffled yells they fled before the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c000'>In less than twenty minutes the vicinity had been practically cleared
of savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>They retreated to a point below where their ponies were corralled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mounting, they dashed away to the westward. The Steam Man
pursued until finding a creek, they escaped for good.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Steam Man returned to camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>But although the foe had been repulsed, matters were still bad
enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>Walter Barrows and Bessie Rodman were missing.</p>

<p class='c000'>That they were captives was a forlorn hope. That they had been
murdered was a dreadful fear.</p>

<p class='c000'>Delay was almost fatal in this case. Without loss of time a good
trailer was put upon the trail of the lovers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Daylight was breaking in the east, and this enabled him to easily
follow the trail.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along the banks of the creek it ran for nearly a fifth of a mile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the trailer paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here without doubt was the spot where Barrows had been attacked
by the Apaches.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were footprints and marks of a struggle. A rifle, with broken
stock, was picked up,</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is Barrows’ gun,” said one of the Vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Blood was found upon the ground, but no trace of the bodies.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They have been taken away as captives,” declared Harmon, positively.
“There is no doubt of that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Or thrown into the creek,” suggested one of the Vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Investigation for a moment gave the pursuers a thrill of horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were footprints down to the water’s edge, and the marks of
some heavy body dragged thither.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the shallow water, protected by reeds, was a body.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment all expected to recognize Barrows. But all drew a
breath of relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The body was that of one of the Apaches. Doubtless it was one
shot by Barrows, and his body had been thrown into this place to escape
the notice of the white pursuers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s an Injun trick,” declared Harmon, positively. “I’m
mighty well satisfied that the captives are alive.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope you are right,” said one man.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ditto!” said another.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then let us take the trail,” cried Frank Reade, Jr. “If possible,
we must rescue them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The question was settled at once. All sprung to saddle, and the
trail, which was quite plain, was followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Across the prairies went the Steam Man, with the Vigilants behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course their horses could not compete with the Man on a level
stretch, but Frank did not try to run away from them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians bore away to a southwesterly course, and soon a range
of hills became visible above the horizon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harmon made them out as the Black Bear range.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If they get into those hills with the captives,” he declared, “we’ll
have mighty hard work diggin’ ‘em out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why?” asked one of his men.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bekase, there’s more holes and out of the way dens there than
you could shake a stick at.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp crouched down in the wagon, and kept their rifles
in readiness for business.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., watched the plain ahead with eager eye, but
though the trail was plain there was yet no signs of overtaking the
red foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they drew nearer the hills it became almost a certainty that the
savages had sought refuge there.</p>

<p class='c000'>A long stretch of plain intervened to the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was easily to be inspected with a glass, and Frank did so.
There was no sign whatever of the Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>All hope was thus given up of overtaking the redskins before reaching
the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed a certainty that they had reached their caves, and the
only alternative left was to scour them thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when quite near an entrance between high hills, suddenly the
pursuers topped a rise in the prairie and were rewarded with a startling
sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just below, in a depression, was the band of savages, seemingly engaged
in making camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>A small creek ran through this depression,</p>

<p class='c000'>As is well known, Indians always encamp upon the banks of a
stream. Yet it was a surprise to the pursuers that they should venture
to camp in this open spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>At sight of their foes the astonished redskins were thrown into a
tumult.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly a mad retreat was begun for the mountains.</p>

<p class='c000'>A wild cheer pealed from the lips of the vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harman settled himself in his saddle and shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Forward, all! Charge!”</p>

<p class='c000'>With a yell the Vigilants put spurs to their horses and made for the
Indian encampment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., started the Steam Man on a circuit to head off
the savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as he did so Pomp clutched his arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hi dar, Marse Frank!” cried the darky. “Does yo’ see dat little
party ober dar making fo’ de hills?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank did see them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, dat am Missy Bessie an’ her lover jes’ as suah as yo’ am
bo’n, Marse Frank, an’ dar am half a dozen Injuns jes’ holding onto de
bridles ob der hosses. I makes it out, sah, dat dey fink dey kin reach
de hills afo’ de Steam Man, sah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jupiter, you’re right, Pomp!” cried Frank, with inspiration.
“But we’ll try and spoil that little game.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dat’s right, Marse Frank!” cried the darkey. “I jes’ fink de Man
kin obertake dem hosses suah enuff.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank seized the reins and pulled open the throttle.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Steam Man went forward with his mighty stride Frank
opened the whistle valve and let out a mighty shriek of such loudness
that the echoes were repeated a hundred fold in the recesses of the
hills.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>IN HOT PURSUIT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The party of savages with the two captives in their midst, evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>intended to reach the hills, if possible, before being overtaken
by the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first Frank had fancied it easy to cut them off.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there were several depressions in the prairie which the Man had
to circuit, and the distance was greater than Frank had really
dreamed of.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like a runaway locomotive the Steam Man raced over the plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vigilants were having a running fight with the savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank Reade, Jr., was doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p class='c000'>He failed to cut off the band of abductors, and they vanished from
sight in a deep pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was too rocky a trail for the Steam Man to follow. Thus far the
villains had the best of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly sakes, Marse Frank!” cried Pomp, “dey done git away wif
dem prisoners fo’ suah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It looks like it,” agreed Frank, in a baffled tone, “but there
ought to be some way to cut them off.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, there’s only won way,” declared Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let the naygur sthay with the man, an’ you an’ I will go afther
the divils a-foot,” said the Celt.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment Frank entertained no hopes of the success of such a
plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he glanced back to the prairie where the vigilants and the
Indians were having their Battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was nip and tuck between them, but Frank saw that the vigilants
were fast getting the best of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not more than half a dozen of the savages had the captives in charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>To be sure, the odds were three to one, yet Frank believed that with
the plucky Barney’s help, they could defeat them.</p>

<p class='c000'>To think with Frank Reade, Jr., was to act.</p>

<p class='c000'>He did not waste time, but seizing a rifle, cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your idea is a good one, Barney. We will act upon it. Pomp, keep
a sharp eye out for danger untill we return.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A’right Marse Frank,” replied the faithful darky.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney, delighted that Frank had seen fit to adopt his plan, was
quickly ready and they left the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians, to be sure, had the start of them, but the pass was
rocky and it was hardly likely that they would succeed in getting a
great lead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Swiftly the two rescuers pressed forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>They climbed over piles of bowlders, crept through narrow defiles,
and climbed high steeps.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed that progress must be slow for the ponies of the Indians,
and they should be overtaken before long.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly Barney paused with a sharp cry.</p>

<p class='c000'>He seized Frank by the arm and pulled him back into the cover of
an angle in the mountain wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was none too soon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crack of rifles smote upon the air and the shower of bullets came
down into the pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, I saw the spalpeens just in the nick av time!” declared
Barney, peering around the edge of the cliff wall. “Av I hadn’t we’d
have been dead gossoons as sure as me name is Barney.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re right there!” cried Frank, slipping extra cartridges into
his rifle; “that was a close call.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indade it was.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had no idea we were so near the rascals.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, I didn’t mesilf till I see the top-knot av wan of thim
over that ridge yonder.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are ready for us, then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, and we’re ready too. If I iver get a bead on any wan
av them there’ll be a job for the coroner, bad cess to thim.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are they? I can’t see their position very well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aisy, Misther Frank,” said Barney, “they’re hiding up yonder
jist ferninst that big scrub av an oak on the edge of the cliff.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank looked in that direction. Suddenly Barney gave a sharp
cry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whurro!” he yelled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quick as a flash his rifle went to his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crack!</p>

<p class='c000'>A yell of agony rang through the gorge. Then down over the cliff
tumbled an Indian almost at the Celt’s feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bullet had pierced his skull and his final account was settled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good shot, Barney!” cried Frank, “that only leaves five for us to
tackle.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then quick as a flash the young inventor threw his rifle to his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crack!</p>

<p class='c000'>Another yell, a death cry went up on the air of the defile.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, that’s only four av the divils left,” chuckled Barney.
“It’s only two to wan, Misther Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re right, Barney!” cried Frank, with enthusiasm, “but the
odds are yet too great.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The outlook now was certainly encouraging for the rescue of the
prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the two rescuers knew better than to essay an open attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indian method of warfare was in this case far the best. They
remained strictly under cover.</p>

<p class='c000'>All was quiet on the bluff above.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was not by any means likely that the foe were inactive.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great danger now was that they would continue to slip away
deeper into the hills and reach some inaccessible hiding place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our rescuers waited as long as seemed consistent with safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think we’d better make a break, Barney.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All roight, sorr,” replied the Celt. “Do yez think it safe?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must use caution. It may be possible that they are trying to
draw us from our hiding place.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So I thought, sorr.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Again, they may be far into the hills by this time. We will gain
nothing by staying here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All roight, sorr.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney begun to scan the side of the cliff. A path was not visible
anywhere. Yet the Celt did not believe it impossible to climb to the
top.</p>

<p class='c000'>If this could be done they might then succeed in getting upon level
ground with the foe and escape the risk of their bullets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank divined Barney’s purpose and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think we can climb it, Barney.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers we’ll thry.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney had just got his hands and feet into niches in the cliff when
a startling sound came up the pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hark!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The tramp of ponies’ feet could be heard and the distant baffled
yells of savages were wafted up on the breeze.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Indians are coming up the pass,” cried Frank, with dismay.
“Barney, there’s not an instant to lose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, yez are roight,” cried the Celt, beginning to make his
way up the cliff.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a smart climb up the steep wall, but it was safely made at
length.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were now on level ground with the four captors. But a careful
reconnoitering of the vicinity showed that they had left.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the lull in the conflict they had slipped away into the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Barney took the trail and they went forward again in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sounds of the foe coming up the pass in their rear, however,
every moment became plainer.</p>

<p class='c000'>But fortunately, just at a point where the trail diverged deeper into
the hills, the foe must have turned in another direction for very soon
the sounds died out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have nothing to fear from them,” cried Frank, with a breath
of relief. “They have gone in another direction.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Very soon the hills began to merge into a deep valley. Through
this there ran a swift stream.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Frank and Barney entered the valley Barney shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be me sowl, there be the spalpeens now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jist down there ferninst that grove of trees, Misther Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sure enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The four savages and their captors were plainly seen on the
banks of the creek.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were just in the act of embarking in a canoe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw that he must act quick if he would prevent this.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he said, sharply:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go to the right, Barney, I will go to the left, and we must head
them off.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, sorr.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Away went Barney on the mad run. The savages had already got
the canoe into the<a id='t16'></a> water.</p>

<p class='c000'>They saw him coming and a yell was the signal. The captives were
hustled into the light craft and it was pushed out from the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down into the current it went. There was no time to lose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., came to a stop and raised his rifle. It was a desperate
chance but he took it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A quick aim, a bead skillfully drawn on one of the paddlers
and——</p>

<p class='c000'>Crack!</p>

<p class='c000'>A wild Indian yell went up and the prow of the canoe swung
around.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over into the water went the doomed savage. The shot had been a
good one.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the canoe was at the moment at the head of some swift rapids.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment it was racing down them, and turning a bend in
the stream, vanished from view.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had not time to draw another bead before it was out of sight,
and when it reached the lower level and came into view again it was
out of range.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney came along now and shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be jabers, yez did well, Misther Frank. That was a beautiful shot.
There’s only three av ther red divils left.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was true, but the three savages seemed likely to elude their
pursuers after all.</p>

<p class='c000'>The canoe was racing down the stream, and fast nearing a defile in
the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it should enter this, there was little doubt but that the fugitives
would make their escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Barney saw this in the same moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, Mother Frank, we must cut the divils off!” cried the Celt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Forward, then!” cried Frank. “Is there not a short cut?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Both looked for this. In the same instant they espied it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The creek took a long turn, and by cutting directly across a meadow
the two pursuers saw that they would be likely to cut off the savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly they started forward on the run.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indian captors saw their move at once, and an angry yell went
up from them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>One of them rose in the canoe and took quick aim and fired.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bullet whistled close to Barney’s ear. The Celt stopped and
cocked his rifle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be jabers, I’ll spoil that fellow!” he cried, “Have at yez, ye
blatherskite!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney’s rifle spoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the motion of the canoe very likely destroyed the aim, for the
bullet did not take effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this point the canoe took a swift course, and in the twinkling
of an eye seemed to have overcome the skilled hand at the paddles.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a flash it went over and the entire party were dumped into the
waters of the creek.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great cry went up from Frank Reade, Jr.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My God! they will be drowned!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Forward the brave young inventor rushed. He thought of poor
Barrows with his hands tied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thrown into the waters of the creek, it did not seem as if any power
on earth could save him.</p>

<p class='c000'>But two of the savages had seized the prisoners. The canoe had
overturned in close proximity to the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third savage gave assistance, and as the water did not chance
to be deep, all got ashore.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now we have them!” cried Frank, confidently.</p>

<p class='c000'>But his statement was premature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even as it seemed that the rescue was certain, an incident occurred
to prevent.</p>

<p class='c000'>From behind a small hillock appeared Red Bear’s gang of Apaches,
full half a hundred strong.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE VIGILANTES TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The appearance of the savages was most inopportune.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mounted on their fleet ponies, with wild yells they swept down
upon the party.</p>

<p class='c000'>The three Indian captors yelled with delight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Barney of course came to a halt. Of course it was folly
to tempt fate.</p>

<p class='c000'>To attempt to stand against that gang was folly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jupiter!” gasped the young inventor. “It’s all up with us,
Barney! We are badly beaten!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tare an’ ‘ounds!” grumbled the angry Celt. “That beats all me
woife’s relations! Phwativer shall we do now, Misther Frank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Beat a retreat,” declared the young inventor. “Come on,
Barney!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s mesilf as hates to retreat,” said Barney, stubbornly. “Oh, if
we only had the Steam Man an’ the naygur here now we’d moighty
soon turn the thing about.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The two rescuers now turned about and hastily beat a retreat
across the valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they had not gone far when the Indians began to ford the
creek for the purpose of giving pursuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney saw the move and called Frank’s attention to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be me sowl, Misther Frank!” cried the Irishman, excitedly,
“we’ve got to make quick toime, or they’ll have our scalps.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right, Barney.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But at that moment Frank Reade, Jr., lifted his gaze, and a mighty
cry escaped his lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>Directly in front of them, a body of armed men swept into the valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were the Vigilants, and at their head rode Harmon. At sight
of Frank and Barney they urged their horses on faster with a loud
cheer.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was answered by the two fugitives, with a will.</p>

<p class='c000'>The savages, seeing the Vigilants, now changed their tactics. They
turned their horses about and rode swiftly on the back trail.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank could hardly wait for Harmon and his men to come up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Enthusiastic greetings were exchanged, and also experiences.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Vigilants had driven the Apaches before them into the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>But upon entering the fastnesses, with which they were not familiar,
the Indians had given them the slip.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the search, they had come upon the scene at an opportune moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>There seemed no better thing to do than to give pursuit to the savages
at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly a couple of spare horses were provided for Frank and
Barney, and they rode forward on the charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The delay had been brief, but it had enabled the savages to cross
the creek and start for the defile beyond,</p>

<p class='c000'>Down thundered the vigilants in hot pursuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The creek was quickly forded and the pursuers seemed to be gaining
at every bound.</p>

<p class='c000'>But of a sudden the savages executed a peculiar and inexplicable
maneuver.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly and without warning they split in two sections, one going
to the right and the other to the left.</p>

<p class='c000'>In one division was the girl captive, Bessie Rodman, and in the
other Walter Barrows.</p>

<p class='c000'>The party who had the girl in charge started for the defile.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other made directly across the valley. In a flash of time the
purpose of the savages was made apparent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vigilants could not go both ways with splitting up.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they were much less in number than the Apaches the result of
this would be to greatly weaken them, if not actually place them at
the mercy of the red foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand it was a problem as to which direction to pursue
or which party to follow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Harmon drew a slight rein upon his horse and wavered a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vigilants naturally were inclined to go to the rescue of their
comrade, but Frank Reade, Jr., comprehending the folly of this,
cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The girl first. We can rescue the man later.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes!” cried Harmon, in a voice of thunder; “that is our duty!
The girl first, boys; then we will try and save Barrows.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The vigilants cheered, and away thundered the troop toward the
defile.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few moments later they reached it and entered it.</p>

<p class='c000'>High walls of black, forbidding rock arose on either side to a mighty
height. The bed of the defile was rough and strewn with bowlders.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was harder for the horses of the vigilants to pick their way
through here than the fleet-footed ponies of the savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly the Indians gained quite a lead. But after a quarter
of a mile of the defile had been traversed the vigilants were brought
to a halt in an unceremonious manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The defile seemed suddenly to take an upward trend here, and high
piles of bowlders made a barrier of some height.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly from behind this barrier there came the flash of rifle muzzles,
and a volley of bullets came rattling down through the defile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two of the vigilants were wounded, and Harmon instantly called a
halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cover was quickly sought behind rocks and corners near.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evident that the Indians had here made a stand. The Vigilant
leader was puzzled.</p>

<p class='c000'>But suddenly Frank Reade, Jr., gave a sharp cry:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Listen!”</p>

<p class='c000'>His acute ear had caught the sound of horses’ hoofs coming up the
defile in their rear.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By thunder!” ejaculated Harmon, with sudden terrible comprehension,
“we are trapped!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The men gazed blankly at each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing was more apparent. The Apaches under the shrewd Red
Bear had certainly very cleverly outgeneraled them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Led into the defile by one division of the Apaches, the other had
proceeded to block up the outlet, and thus literally the Vigilants
were in a trap.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was not the advantage in facing a foe in this manner that
there was in having him wholly in the front.</p>

<p class='c000'>To be attacked both front and rear would demoralize even the
largest and bravest of armies. Harmon was completely taken aback.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wall, I swan!” he exclaimed, with earnestness, “I never believed
an Injun could beat me in any such way as that. But we are in for
it, boys, and no mistake. We’ve got to fight hard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The savages in front were keeping up a raking fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those in the rear had now drawn near enough to also open fire.
The fun had begun.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the brave band of white men had no thought of fear or of retreat.</p>

<p class='c000'>They at once, by Harmon’s direction, sought safe places of cover
and proceeded to return the fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every time an Indian’s top-knot showed above the fringe of rocks,
it was made a target of.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, the battle was kept up for over an hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then an idea occurred to the inventive mind of Frank Reade, Jr.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had carefully examined the face of the pass. In doing so he had
discovered what looked like a feasible foot path over the cliff.</p>

<p class='c000'>At once he called Harmon aside and explained a plan to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think we can defeat the savages easily in this manner,” he declared.
“Give me five men and I will guarantee a surprise for them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Reade, take what force you need,” declared the vigilant
leader. “I have full confidence in your ability to do as you say. May
you succeed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank at once selected five men from the troop.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then with Barney he led the way cautiously up the path.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately, it was overhung with foliage to a large extent, so that
they were hidden from the view of those in their rear.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments a position near the brow of the cliff had been
reached. Then Frank’s surmise was verified.</p>

<p class='c000'>The little party could look down upon the heads of the savages. It
was an easy matter to pour a volley amongst them with most demoralizing
effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank sent one of the men back down the cliff, to give Harmon the
cue when to make a charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then at a favorable moment Frank gave the order to fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>Six repeating rifles were turned upon the savages, and as fast as
they could be worked, they were engaged in firing a volley down upon
the heads of the exposed savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effect was startling.</p>

<p class='c000'>The savage is never the one to stand in open field and fight. At once
a panic seized them.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the moment for the charge, and Harmon’s men rushed forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up over the rocks they went. In a twinkling the savages were
driven from their entrenchments and utterly routed, and completely
dispersed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., and Barney saw their opportunity, and rushed
upon two of the savages who had Bessie Rodman in charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment the girl captive was free once more and among
friends. The two guards fled for their lives.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>All this had happened in a twinkling of an eye, comparatively
speaking. But the fight was not over.</p>

<p class='c000'>The force in the rear were coming to the attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Harmon’s men were now in a position to command the defile.</p>

<p class='c000'>A quick, sharp conflict ensued, and the Apaches were driven back
with great slaughter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vigilants had thus far the best of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enemy had been routed, and Bessie Rodman rescued.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only one other thing now remained to be accomplished, and this
was the rescue of Walter Barrows.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even as the question was being discussed a loud cry arose,
and the next moment a hatless, blood-stained young man came dashing
down over the cliff and fell half fainting in the midst of the vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Barrows.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the midst of the fight the plucky young plainsman had succeeded
in breaking his bonds, and after a desperate fight with two of his
captors, had made his escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everybody extended congratulations to the young couple, and then
plans for the future were discussed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not certain that the savages would not return to the attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>But a report was brought in by a number of scouts sent out that
the Apaches had withdrawn from the field entirely.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was therefore decided to go back to Willow Creek.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not known whether Col. Clark had been victorious with the
cowboys or nor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Until this question was settled Harmon had no idea of returning
home.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Until Cliff and his gang have been wiped out of existence,” he
declared, “I shall not give up ther chase.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Barney were anxious to return at once to the Steam
Man and Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were, by no means, assured that the darky was safe or that he
might not have got into trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly the start was at once made for the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down one of the defiles the vigilants rode. Coming out into the
little valley they crossed this and entered the pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they had not proceeded a hundred yards into the pass when one
of the advance scouts came rushing back and gave a thrilling report.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ther cowboys are coming up ther pass!” he cried. “Thar’s a
host of ‘em, and Art Cliff is at the head of ‘em.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The cowboys!” gasped Harmon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greatest excitement ensued.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My soul!” exclaimed Frank Reade, Jr., in dismay. “Clark has
been defeated!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bad luck to the omadhouns!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But what of Pomp?” exclaimed Frank with alarm. “Barney, we
ought at once to ascertain where he is.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To be shure, Misther Frank,” agreed the Celt, “but how in the
name av all the saints are yez goin’ to do it? Be jabers, these cowboys
have got us cornered.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a very few moments a large sized battle was in progress in the
pass.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <span class='large'>POMP MAKES ACTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Now let us return to Pomp and the Steam Man, whom in the detail
of the thrilling adventures just chronicled we have neglected.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darkey entertained nothing like fear at being left alone on
board the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, he rather enjoyed the responsibility thus put upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He could occasionally hear rifle shots from the hills, which assured
him that Frank and Barney were making it hot for the savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly!” he muttered, “I jes’ reckon dem Injines git de worstest
ob dat fight. Ki dar, if dey amn’t comin’ dis yer way. I spec’s I better
move.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was true.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians had been driven before the vigilants, and starting for
the hills were coming straight toward the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evident that they meant to enter the hills at this point.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp knew that it would be folly to remain where he was with the
Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The savages might ruin the machine as he could not hope alone to
hold them at bay.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he opened the throttle and started away with the Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>He kept on until satisfied that he had reached a safe point.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the Indians reached the pass and entered it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vigilants, however, did not seem in a hurry to pursue. They
remained on the battle ground for some while looking after their dead
and wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they did start for the pass Pomp had returned and was there
stationed.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they came up the darky put his head out of the screen door and
shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good fo’ yo’, Marse Harmon. Jes yo’ gib dem Injuns a good
lickin’ fo’ luck. I reckon yo’ kin do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I reckon we can, Pomp,” replied Harmon. “At least we’ll try
it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If yo’ sees Marse Frank, jes tole him fo’ me, dat his carriage am
waitin’ fo’ him. Will yo’?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Harmon replied that he would and rode away laughing immoderately.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vigilants all vanished up the pass. It seemed ages after they
had gone, when Pomp received another great surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly, hearing the clatter of hoofs he turned his head, and scrutinized
the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>A thrilling sight met his gaze.</p>

<p class='c000'>There, coming over a swell in the plain was a body of horsemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>It required but a glance for the darky to recognize them.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were the cowboys with Artemus Cliff at their head. They
were riding directly down upon the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were just coming from the scene of their victory over Clark.
Pomp’s eyes stuck out like agates and he sprung to his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Glory fo’ goodness!” he gasped. “Dat am Cliff and his debbils.
I jes’ reckon I get out dere way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In an instant he opened the throttle and let the Steam Man race
out upon the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys gave a wild yell, and attempted pursuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they could not keep anywhere near the Man, and finally abandoned
it. With baffled yells they returned and disappeared in the pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, dat am a berry bad fing for Marse Frank an’ de oders,”
muttered Pomp. “Dey will neber be anticipating de comin’ ob dem
rapscallions, an’ dat will make tings berry bad, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky at once began to wax anxious as to the fate of his friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>He began to feel as if it was very much his duty to enter the hills
and render what assistance he could.</p>

<p class='c000'>But what was to be done with the Steam Man?</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp reflected that he might take it with him if he could only find
some way of doing so.</p>

<p class='c000'>To attempt to traverse the rocky Pass was out of the question.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky was in a quandary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon he heard the sounds of firing. The battle was on, and at no
great distance, either.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp could hardly contain himself. He walked up and down in
the cage like a prisoner in his cell.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ob co’se, I has Marse Frank’s ordahs to stay yere,” he muttered,
“but it am evident dat Marse Frank needs all de help dat he can get.
Whatebber I kin do, I jes’ don’ know what.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky sat down and began sober reflection.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was a shrewd fellow, and as a result he was not long in formulating
a plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sprang up finally.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By golly, I’ll jes’ do dat fing!” he cried, finally. “It am de bes’
fing I kin do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He opened the throttle and started the Steam Man along the base
of the hills. With keen eye he studied the possibility of entering
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the pass it was impossible. But he imagined that it would not
be difficult to find another means.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor was he disappointed.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a certain point the hillside was shorn of trees and bowlders. It
made a smooth surface even over the brow of the height.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Steam Man was provided with power to climb any height of
this sort, Pomp at once set his course up the height.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up went the Steam Man with prodigious strides.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearer the top he drew. Pomp had no means of knowing whether
it would be possible to go further or not.</p>

<p class='c000'>But his best hopes were realized upon reaching the summit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down a gentle incline the Steam Man went, and through a scattered
grove of trees, and came out into a valley deep in the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sound of firing was now quite plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, as Pomp guided the Man down into the valley, he saw the
powder smoke of the conflict in the pass, just a short way up the valley.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By golly!” muttered the darky, joyfully, “I reckon dat I get dar
jes’ in de bes’ time. Won’t Marse Frank be glad fo’ to see me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But at that moment a startling thing occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Man was traveling slowly, when just as the bottom of the incline
was reached, two powerful savages sprung out of the grass and
seized the throttle rein.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp was so taken by surprise that for a moment he could not act.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pulling of the rein closed the throttle, and the Man came to a
halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp could not use the rein to open it again, and had there been
more of the red foe, the Steam Man would have been at their mercy.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there were only two of them, and while one held the rein the
other essayed to hack his way into the wagon with his tomahawk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp acted with the rapidity of thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>“G’way from dar yo’ red imp!” he yelled, picking up a revolver.
“If you don’t I’ll jes’ bore a hole in yo’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the red man did not desist, and Pomp, springing to a loop-hole
fired at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bullet went true to its aim, and the Indian fell dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other savage seeing the fate of his companion let out a baffled
yell, and relaxing his grip on the valve rein fled precipitately.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp did not take the pains to fire at him, but coolly picked up the
valve rein, opened the throttle and the Steam Man went on.</p>

<p class='c000'>Straight for the scene of the conflict at the mouth of the Pass Pomp
went.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he came upon the scene he found a thrilling and sanguine
conflict in progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>At sight of the Steam Man a cheer went up from the Vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment Frank and Barney were aboard and shaking hands
with Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The situation was quickly explained.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thought mos’ likely yo’ would want de Steam Man, Marse Frank,”
said the faithful darky. “So I jes’ fetched him ober to yo’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have done well, Pomp,” said Frank, joyfully. “Of course,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>this insures our safety. With the Steam Man we would easily escape
the cowboys. But it will never do to leave these brave Vigilants
to their mercy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ob co’se not, Marse Frank,” cried Pomp, seizing his rifle. “Jes’
yo’ let dis chile draw a bead on dem rapscallions. I’ll show dem dat
Pomp kin use a rifle.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man was placed in the van of the line of battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Protected as they were by the impervious screen, those on board
could fire with advantage at the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>The battle was a hot one, but every moment the cowboys slowly
gained ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>What was worse, the ammunition of the Vigilants seemed to be
giving out.</p>

<p class='c000'>With plenty of ammunition, it was possible that the Vigilants
could have held them at bay for a long while.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, of course, when the ammunition should give out, the battle
would be ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>White-faced, but determined, the brave plainsmen stood their
ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not a man of them thought of retreat. All were prepared to give
up their lives like heroes.</p>

<p class='c000'>There seemed no way of getting out of their present desperate
situation.</p>

<p class='c000'>To retreat was about equal to an impossibility, for it would be
out upon the open plain where they would be shot down like
sheep.</p>

<p class='c000'>The situation was an awful one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Durn it, I don’t keer for myself,” said bluff Harmon, the vigilant
leader, “but some of the boys have families dependent on ‘em. Ah,
that dog of a Cliff has sins to answer fer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right,” agreed Frank Reade, Jr. “But there must be
some way of getting out of this scrape.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, that is a sticker. There is no hope of reinforcements near?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“None whatever.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Steam Man could be sent for them in quick time, if such a
thing were possible.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But it is not. The nearest place is Ranch V, and that is Cliff’s
own den. We know that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The fort is too far off. There is just one forlorn hope.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The cavalry.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But they may have been all wiped out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very true. Well, we must die then like men. But, Mr. Reade,
there is no reason why you should not take the girl in your Steam
Man and make your escape.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank placed a hand upon the vigilant captain’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes!” he said, briefly. “I could do that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then do it. We will hold the foe at bay until——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Stop!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Harmon looked his surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You do not know me,” said Frank Reade, Jr., determinedly,
“do you think I would desert you in this hour of need?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never! If you die so do we. Until the last the Steam Man will
stand his ground.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With tears of emotion in his eyes Harmon gripped Frank’s hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“God bless you!” was all he could say.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this moment one of the vigilants came up excitedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are just firing the last cartridges,” he declared. “What
shall we do? Is it a retreat, Harmon?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Retreat!” cried the vigilant leader, clubbing his rifle. “Never!
Come on one and all. The crisis has come. Now let us show them
how brave men can die.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys with their wild cheers were forcing the crippled vigilants
back.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even in the moment of their victory a strange sound came
from the rear and a mighty cry went up from the throats of the
vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah! We are saved! Rescue has come at last.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <span class='large'>ONCE MORE IN THE ENEMY’S POWER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It had been Col. Clark’s firm intention to return to the fort for reinforcements.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a long ways, but he did not reckon this. He thought only
of securing a sufficient body of men to cope successfully with the
cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>So on they rode the little remnant of the squad for the far distant
fort.</p>

<p class='c000'>But after a night had been spent in camp, just as the bugle called
“boots and saddles,” one of the guard sighted a body of horsemen
just coming over a swell in the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>The alarm was given and Clark rode out to investigate.</p>

<p class='c000'>One glance was enough and a cry of joy escaped his lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah!” he cried. “We are in luck. It is Romaine’s company
of one hundred men. Forward all!”</p>

<p class='c000'>With cheers the little band rode out to meet the reinforcements.</p>

<p class='c000'>The command had been sent out under Captain Romaine to search
for Clark and his men.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two officers shook hands and explanations were made.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have come just in the nick of time, Romaine,” declared
Clark. “We can now return and whip the cowboys.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are with you, colonel!” declared the captain with a salute.
“The boys are itching for some hot work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I will promise it to them,” laughed Clark, as he took command.</p>

<p class='c000'>At once the cavalry set out at full gallop for the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed like a strange fate that guided them almost to the very
scene of the conflict.</p>

<p class='c000'>The firing was heard long before the pass was reached, and Clark
hurried his men forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>He at once threw them into the pass in the rear of Cliff’s gang.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an opportune moment, too.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as the last cartridge of the vigilants was used the cavalry
struck the rear of the cowboy gang.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly a panic seized Cliff’s men. They made a brief stand,
and then were driven up a side defile into the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here they made a stubborn stand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cavalry literally cleared the pass, and riding through came
into the midst of the vigilants.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scene which followed baffles description.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment Clark and big Harmon were shaking hands with the
deepest emotion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ye came jest in the nick of time, Clark,” declared the vigilant
chief. “In ten minutes more we might have all been dead men.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then we are in luck,” cried the colonel, “for which I am very
glad. Ah, Mr. Reade, I am glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The same,” replied Frank, as he gripped hands with the colonel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Clark rode away up the defile to see what was going on
there.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found the fiercest kind of a battle in progress. The cowboys
had intrenched themselves once more and were making a bold
stand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cavalry outnumbered them, but they were in a very advantageous
position.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best efforts of Clark’s men would not suffice to dislodge them.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a long while the sanguine battle went on.</p>

<p class='c000'>In vain Clark tried to eject them from their position. His bravest
efforts met with failure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The intrepid colonel knew that if he could get the foe into the
open he could hope to whip them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as it was it looked certainly as if his plucky little band would
be badly decimated in the accomplishment of the desired end.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this quandary Frank Reade, Jr., appeared upon the spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor had borrowed a horse of one of the vigilants
and rode up to see how the fight was going on.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, colonel,” he said, greeting Clark, “how are you making
out?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not as well as I could desire,” replied the colonel in a dejected
manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, I can’t drive the rascals.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They have a position up there in the hills which is unassailable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I disagree with you,” said Frank, quietly. “I am not a military
engineer, but I am a land surveyor and I tell you their position on
that hill is not of the best.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clark was staggered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, it is the best position about here,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” said Frank, gravely. “Yonder is a much better position.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He pointed to a hill to the right, and which the one upon which
the cowboys were seemed to overlook.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What—try to command the foe from that hill?” cried Clark,
scornfully. “We would only expose ourselves, and they would
sweep us from it like chaff before the wind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, they wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, Mr. Reade, what is the use for you to talk that way? The
hill upon which they are is higher than this one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It may be higher in the number of feet,” replied Frank, “but
not in advantage of position.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you make that out?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is easy enough to see. The top of this hill is smooth, is it
not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The top of theirs is craggy and they cannot climb up to it. Their
position is far from the top. A position on the top of yonder hill
will easily look down into their camp.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clark was surprised, but he saw the logic of Frank’s remark.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jove!” he cried. “Perhaps you are right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think you will find that I am.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I would have taken my oath that they had the highest position
around here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, that would seem to be really so, for the hill itself is
higher. Yet it is but an optical delusion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clark extended his hand to Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Reade,” he cried warmly. “You are right. I acknowledge
my mistake. Perhaps your opportune suggestion may enable us to
whip the foe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If it is of any value, I am highly pleased!” said Frank, modestly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I feel that it is, and I shall at once proceed to take the hill.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Clark at once proceeded to do this. By his command his men
moved up the back side of the hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>This protected them from the bullets of the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arrived at the top of the smooth hill, it was found that Frank
Reade, Jr., was right.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were enabled to look right down upon the cowboys in their
position.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah!” cried Clark, jubilantly, “that means victory.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A volley was given the astonished cowboys. They returned with
ill effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tables were exactly turned upon them, and they were not
slow to see the point.</p>

<p class='c000'>A red-hot fire was kept up for some little time, but the cowboys no
longer held the advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed it began to look muchly as if they were to be driven from
their position.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly all firing ceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboy gang were not in sight, nor did they fire another
shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clark feared a stratagem or some fatal decoy, and dared not at
once order a charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>But finally he became convinced that the cowboys had evacuated
their position and had made a retreat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Flushed with victory Clark ordered his men to charge.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Up the slope they went with fixed bayonets. But when they
cleared the top of the intrenchments, hastily thrown up by the cowboys,
it was found that they had gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had departed quite unceremoniously and completely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not an article of any kind was left behind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed it also became a mystery as to the course taken by them.
Not a sign of a trail could be found.</p>

<p class='c000'>It baffled the cavalrymen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jupiter!” exclaimed Clark, in disgust, “how are you going to
fight such a shadowy foe. If they would only come out like men
and fight it out it would be all right. But they don’t dare do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You would whip them,” said Frank Reade, Jr., with a laugh.
“That is why they are playing hide and seek.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose so, but it makes it pretty hard for me. I suppose the
best course now is to send out scouts and scour the hills.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right. I will do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope you will succeed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you. I will do it or die.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is a good resolution.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I mean it, every word of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With this Clark ordered his men to horse, and the quest at once
began.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank did not believe that he could be of further service just now,
so he decided to return to the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mounting his horse he rode down through the defile. In a few
moments he reached the spot where the remnant of the brave Vigilant
band were.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was the Steam Man intact, but Frank saw at a glance that
something was wrong about the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everybody appeared to be deeply excited. Young Barrows was
seen wringing his hands and rushing about madly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank sent his horse forward rapidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney saw him coming and ran out to meet him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Och hone, Misther Frank!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well!” exclaimed Frank, reining up his horse, “what is the
matter?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sure, somethin’ terrible has happened since ye went away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, sor, the young lady, Bessie, has gone, sor, an’ divil a wan
av us kin foind her anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bessie Rodman gone?” gasped Frank. “Can that be possible?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, sor, it is, an’ faix they all do believe that the divils av
cowboys, be the orders av Artemus Cliff, have got her agin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great heavens!” cried Frank, with horror, “how on earth could
they have done that? Is there not enough of you here to prevent?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, sor, that is thrue enough,” cried Barney. “But it’s the
girrul’s fault hersilf, as ivery wan believes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her fault!” cried Frank, in surprise. “How could that be?”</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE LOVERS QUEST.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll tell ye how it was, Mister Reade,” cried bluff Harmon; the
vigilant, as he came us. “Ye see the gal took big chances. Thar’s
a spring in that bit av bushes there an’ she went over to git a drink
of water. Nobody has seen her since.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you made a good search?” asked Frank, sharply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“An all fired good one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how do you know that Cliff’s gang have got her?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because we know that it could not be Injuns, for the ground
was marked with prints of the cowboys’ shoes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank received this information with sinking heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that it must be too true that Bessie Rodman had again
fallen into the hands of Cliff.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a dismaying reflection.</p>

<p class='c000'>To effect her rescue would prove no easy task.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just how to go to work to do it was a problem to Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he was not long in deciding upon a plan of action.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile young Barrows, desperate over the thought that his
girl love was once more in Cliff’s power, had made a daring move.</p>

<p class='c000'>Alone he rode away into the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was determined to rescue Bessie or sacrifice his life in the
attempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barrows was a youth of rare pluck and great determination.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this quest he was aided by his blind love for Bessie Rodman.
For her he would gladly give up his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Striking into the hills he sought to follow the trail of the abductors.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was soon lost in the flinty ground, and his best efforts to
recover it were in vain.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, he kept on with feverish resolution. It was now a
blind quest, but this did not deter him in the least.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon Barrows had penetrated deep into the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>He heard the distant sounds of firing and knew that the soldiers
and Cliff’s men were yet having it out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“God give me strength to rescue Bessie Rodman!” he prayed, as
he rode on.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had occurred to Barrows that the young girl might have been
taken to Ranch V by her captors.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had half made up his mind to proceed thither when a thrilling
thing occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly the sharp crack of a rifle smote upon the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barrows reeled in the saddle and his horse gave a plunge.</p>

<p class='c000'>A line of red blood trickled down over his face. The bullet had
grazed his cheek bone.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a narrow escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fraction of an inch in another direction, and the bullet might
have penetrated his brain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Young Barrows had faced danger and death times enough to
know quite well what to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>He instantly dropped from his horse and spoke a word of command
to the animal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The faithful and well-trained steed wheeled and galloped away
into the cover of timber near.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barrows himself sank down behind a pile of rocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this was done in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trained westerner whose life is in danger knows well the
value of quick action.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was this which saved the life of Barrows, for half a dozen bullets
came whistling down the mountain side the next moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had run unconsciously upon his foes. He experienced a thrill
as it occurred to him that this was most likely the party who had
Bessie Rodman in their charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heaven help me now!” he muttered, fervently. “I must save
her or die!”</p>

<p class='c000'>From his position he could safely scrutinize the mountain side.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw that far up on its side there was a rude cabin made of
bark and logs.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this the storm of bullets had come.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing could be seen of those within the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Barrows believed that not only was the foe within, but also
Bessie Rodman.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was somewhat at a loss now to know just what move to make.</p>

<p class='c000'>To advance openly to the attack would have been an act of folly.</p>

<p class='c000'>He would certainly have met his death in a summary fashion.</p>

<p class='c000'>So while pondering on the subject he continued to watch the
cabin windows.</p>

<p class='c000'>He held his rifle in readiness for instant use.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly a face appeared for an instant at one of the windows.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was quickly withdrawn, and Barrows had not time to fire. He
recognized it, however, as the face of one of the outlaws.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young plainsman’s nerves were steel, and he watched his
chance again with nervous anxiety.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly the opportunity came. Once more the face appeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barrows raised his rifle quick as thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crack!</p>

<p class='c000'>A wild cry went up, the sound of a falling body was heard, and
then the tramping of feet and bitter curses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barrows knew that his shot had taken effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he changed his position. But not a sound or a sign of life
came from the mysterious cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If they are in the cabin they are keeping mighty dark,” he muttered.
“They surely must be there, for I have not seen them come
out as yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A great length of time had elapsed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Certainly an hour and a half of waiting had passed, and Barrows
felt that he must do something and at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall die of worriment if I stay here,” he muttered. “Perhaps——”</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused. A thrilling thought had struck him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was more than likely that he had been waiting all this while
for nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would have been not by any means a difficult matter for the foe
to have slipped out by a rear exit, and by this time be far from the
spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>But how was he to determine this fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>It could only be done by approaching the hut boldly and searching
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>To do this was to incur the risk of a bullet from the outlaws.</p>

<p class='c000'>This might be only a clever trick of theirs to draw him from his
covert.</p>

<p class='c000'>All these thoughts passed kaleidoscope-like through Barrow’s
brain.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was satisfied that the foe could be but a half dozen in number.</p>

<p class='c000'>If he could have kept up a desultory battle with them in his present
position he believed that he could have picked off a number of
them, and thus reducing their numbers eventually bring the fight
to a focus with a fair chance of winning.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the outlook now was by no means so prepossessing.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was more than likely that he would have great difficulty in
cutting off the abductors before they should join the main body of
the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this case it would be more difficult to rescue Bessie Rodman.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barrows now realized his folly in starting out single handed to
pursue the abductors.</p>

<p class='c000'>If he had now several of his companions with him the hut could
have been surrounded and there would have been little trouble in
making the rescue.</p>

<p class='c000'>But time was speeding and something had got to be done at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barrows proceeded to act.</p>

<p class='c000'>He began to cautiously climb up the mountain side keeping in the
cover of rocks and trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was very careful not to expose himself to a shot and in this
way had soon reached a point from which he believed he could see
the rear end of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>There it stood lonely and silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was it really deserted or were the foe yet within its walls?”</p>

<p class='c000'>To all appearances it was deserted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barrows hesitated a moment and then took the desperate chance.</p>

<p class='c000'>He emerged boldly from the woods and approached the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>On he went until within ten yards of the door. Yet there was no
sign of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment he reached the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>It yielded to his touch and he entered. The place was deserted.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were evidences that the foe had been there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Also Barrows made a thrilling discovery. In the soft dirt of the
floor he discovered the footprints of Bessie Rodman.</p>

<p class='c000'>At least it was safe to presume that they were hers, for there was
no likelihood that the region for many miles held another of her
gentle sex.</p>

<p class='c000'>Feverishly Barrows examined the trail and followed it out
through a rear door of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>It led into a narrow gulch and up the mountain.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was quickly lost in the gravelly soil, but Barrows kept on up
the mountain.</p>

<p class='c000'>He now censured himself for not having acted with greater dispatch.</p>

<p class='c000'>He believed that had he changed his position earlier he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>have become aware sooner of the change of base of the abductors.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was undoubtedly true, but on the other hand there had been
the great risk of exposure to a bullet.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the whole the lover felt that he had reason to be grateful for
his success in so promptly striking the trail of the foe.</p>

<p class='c000'>He kept on up the mountain with increasing hopes.</p>

<p class='c000'>If he could once more overtake the abductors under more favorable
circumstances he believed that he could effect the rescue of
Bessie Rodman.</p>

<p class='c000'>He still kept on up the mountain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he suddenly halted at a point from which he had a good
view of the country about.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked down upon a level plain below some distance which
was fringed with trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the verge of this timber line Barrows saw a number of moving
figures.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was satisfied that they were the party of abductors and he even
fancied he could see the form of Bessie Rodman.</p>

<p class='c000'>With deadly resolution Barrows started in pursuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down the mountain he went and soon reached the level of the
plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The party was now out of sight but Barrows believed that he
could overtake them.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he set out at a rapid pace along the verge of the timber. Exciting
experiences were in store for him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <span class='large'>FRANK’S NARROW ESCAPE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Frank Reade, Jr., had decided to go at once in quest of the abductors
of Bessie Rodman.</p>

<p class='c000'>He called Pomp and Barney aboard the Steam Man, and the start
was made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course they were not aware that Barrows had started out upon
the same mission.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was decided to proceed up the Death Gulch, for Frank fancied
that the abductors had likely struck out over the mountain range.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gulch could be traversed by the Steam Man easily, and Frank
deemed it safer to travel that way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up the gulch the Steam Man went.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some distance all went well, and no incident worthy of note
occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>But finally a branch of the canyon was reached, and here a halt
was called.</p>

<p class='c000'>This extended to the southward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank knew that the outlaws could not have crossed this without
a wide detour.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ground was high above the walls of the canyon, and the
young Inventor decided upon a different move.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man proceeded up this canyon for some ways.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank called a halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will stop here,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, Misther Frank,” cried Barney, “phwat iver do yez want
to do that fer? It’s a clear course ahead.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am well aware of that, Barney,” replied Frank, “but I am not
sure that we are following the right course.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indade, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I mean to climb to the top of the canyon wall here and take a
look off at the country.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure enough, sor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, Marse Frank, amn’t youse gwine to let dis chile go wif
yo’?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, not a bit av it!” cried Barney. “Shure, yez may stay
wid the Stheam Man, naygur.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ g’long, I’ish! I reckon Marse Frank take me dis time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank smiled and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, it is no more than fair, Pomp, for you to go this time. You
will remain with the Man, Barney.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney did not demur, for he knew that it would be of no use.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he had been with Frank on excursions many times, and perhaps
felt that it was no more than fair that Pomp should have this
chance.</p>

<p class='c000'>No time was lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>Armed with rifles and revolvers, the two explorers left the Steam
Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>A good path up the canyon wall was selected, and after an arduous
climb they finally reached the summit.</p>

<p class='c000'>From here a mighty view of the country about was obtained.</p>

<p class='c000'>As far as the eye could reach to the eastward was the level expanse
of plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the other direction mountain peaks rose above them to a great
altitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had a powerful glass, and with this proceeded to scrutinize
the country below.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he could see nothing of the cowboys, nor was he able to tell
what direction Clark’s men had gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>He descried at once what he believed to be smoke ascending from
behind distant trees, and fancied that this might be from the guns
of the military and the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>But of this he was not sufficiently positive to venture to go thither.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Pomp!” he said dubiously, as he closed the glass, “I
don’t see that we can locate the abductors of Bessie Rodman from
here I declare I am befogged.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, Marse Frank,” cried Pomp, with dilated eyeballs, “what
eber yo’ tink we bettah do now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I declare I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’se done reckon dat de cowboys hab gone back to dat ranch ob
dere’d wid dat lily gal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank gave a start.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had not before occurred to him that the abductors might have
taken their captive to Ranch V.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, so strongly did he become impressed with the possibility
that he was half inclined to start at once for the ranch.</p>

<p class='c000'>But sober second thought impelled him first to think of searching
the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>If she could not be found in them then it would be time enough to
think of paying Ranch V a visit.</p>

<p class='c000'>An incident happened at the moment also that for a time prevented
any move of the sort.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp had begun to scale a small peak near.</p>

<p class='c000'>“P’ra’ps I kin get a bettah look from up yere, Marse Frank!” cried
the darky. “Jes’ de same, I tries it fo’ yo’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, Pomp,” replied Frank. “Tell me if you see anything
of importance and I will come up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A’right, sah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp went up the peak.</p>

<p class='c000'>He reached the top and began to look over the country, when
suddenly he beheld a thrilling scene below.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had gone to the edge of the canyon to look over and see
what the Steam Man was about.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he leaned over the edge of the deep gorge he did not see a
giant form suddenly glide from a crevice in the cliff behind him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was, in reality, an enormous black bear.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brute had caught sight of Frank, and being in an ugly mood,
started for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bear advanced so quickly and noiselessly that Frank was all
unaware of his presence until the brute was upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a terrific blow from the bear’s paw sent him reeling over
the edge of the cliff.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over the edge went the young inventor, and a yell of horror and
pain went up from Pomp’s lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly sakes, Marse Frank, hab yo’ fallen down to yo’ death?”
cried the affrighted darky, as he came tumbling down the peak like
a madman.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had certainly gone over the edge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bear stood upon the verge of the precipice growling savagely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp was in a frenzy of fear and horror. He could not see what
was to prevent his beloved master from going down to his death.</p>

<p class='c000'>He would have rushed to the spot where Frank had stood but the
bear was there.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this moment the stillness of the gorge was broken by the shrill
whistle of the Steam Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was enough for Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment he raised his rifle and fired at the bear.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ordinarily, he would have been compelled to fire many times, but
as chance had it, this single shot proved fatal.</p>

<p class='c000'>It struck the bear full in the eye and went crashing through his
brain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The big brute went over the edge of the precipice and crashing
down into the gorge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp heard plainly the crash of the bear’s body as it struck the
bottom of the pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he rushed to the edge and looked over.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw the bottom of the gorge plainly enough. There lay the
inanimate form of the bear.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man stood not twenty yards distant from this spot,
and Pomp saw Barney far below, yelling and waving his hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky answered, and then caught sight of something which
thrilled him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clinging to a jutting bit of rock in the canyon wall he saw Frank
Reade, Jr., hanging between heaven and earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The astonished darky fell upon his stomach and leaned far over
the edge of the gorge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, Marse Frank!” he cried, excitedly, “I done fought yo’ was
a-goner fo’ suah. Hab yo’ got a stronghold dar?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pomp!” cried Frank, in sharp tones, “I am nearly exhausted.
I fear I shall lose my hoid here soon!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ Hehben’s sake,” cried the affrighted darky, “don’ yo’ say
dat, Marse Frank. If yo’ fell down to de cornah ob dat gorge yo’
would be killed fo’ suah. Yo’ jes’ wait an’ dis chile will help yo’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll have to hurry, Pomp!” cried Frank, in an exhausted manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo’ kin jest bet I will.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whurroo, there naygur!” cried Barney from below. “Wud yez
be afther letting down a rope to Misther Frank. Quick, now, or yez
won’t have the toime.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp acted quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky carried constantly a lariat at his waste.</p>

<p class='c000'>This he lowered over the edge and down to the point where Frank
was hanging suspended between earth and sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp had acted with great dispatch, but even as the rope went
over the edge, a warning cry went up from Barney below.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My God! I am falling!” cried Frank, with horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>His hands were slipping over the edge of the jutting bit of rock to
which he clung.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment they released their grip entirely and down he
went.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, as good fortune had it, just below him was a stump growing
out of the cliff.</p>

<p class='c000'>Against this he fell and his clothing caught upon a jagged root.</p>

<p class='c000'>It held him firmly, and there he hung safe and secure.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of joy went up from Pomp and Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jes’ yo’ hang right on, Marse Frank!” cried the darky, earnestly.
“Don’ yo’ gib way at all, an’ dis chile he done pull you up
a’right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, Pomp,” cried Frank, regaining his coolness so habitual
to him. “I think I am safe here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Praise de Lor’ fo’ dat?” cried the elated darky. “Jes’ hol’ right
on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Down went the lariat.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment more it settled over Frank’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Pomp drew on it, Frank made it secure under his arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the darky began to draw up on the rope. It required some
exertion of strength, but in a few moments Frank cleared the
edge.</p>

<p class='c000'>But at this moment a loud shout came up from the gorge below.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Barney’s voice raised in a note of alarm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My soul!” cried Frank, excitedly. “What can have happened?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Both rushed to the edge of the canyon and looked over.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE FLOOD—CORNERING THE FOE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It was a thrilling sight which met their gaze.</p>

<p class='c000'>They saw Barney leaping up and down and gesticulating wildly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is the matter?” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>But before the words had fairly left his lips he saw what was the
trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along the bottom of the gorge a thin stream of water was flowing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every moment it was increasing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, Misther Frank, is there much more wather comin’?”
cried Barney. “Shure if so, I’m thinkin’ we’d better be after getting
out of here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Right?” cried the young inventor, excitedly, “but where can it
come from?”</p>

<p class='c000'>He ran to an eminence near and from which a good view of the
upper canyon could be had.</p>

<p class='c000'>And there Frank beheld a thrilling sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the upper end of the canyon was a large lake made by an accumulation
of logs and debris across the source of the canyon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here half a score of men with axes and iron bars were engaged
in breaking the dam so as to let the whole lake down into the
gorge.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would mean a flood of awful sort if they succeeded.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would surely sweep the canyon clear, and the position of Barney
was a most perilous one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw this with horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew at once that the workmen were of the cowboy gang.</p>

<p class='c000'>Already the dam could be seen to be giving way.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a very few moments the flood must come. No time must be
lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>Into the canyon the water would plunge and engulf everything in
their path.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank waited no longer.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sprung to the edge of the canyon and shouted to Barney:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go, for your life, Barney. Run for the plain. We will take care
of ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, sar!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney sprung into the cage and away went the Steam Man with
a shriek down the canyon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment a terrible roar came from the headwaters of
the gorge, and then Frank and Pomp saw the mighty flood coming.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like a race horse it surged down through the canyon.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was now a mad race between the Steam Man and the flood.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a long ways to the plain below, and Frank groaned with
horror as he realized the uncertainty of the Steam Man’s reaching it.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were places where the Steam Man must go slowly, and this
would mean overtaking by the flood.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Barney, with his shrewd Irish wit, had realized this.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that it would so impossible for him to reach the plain
before the flood.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he decided upon a wise move.</p>

<p class='c000'>He reached the junction of this canyon with the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was not a moment to spare.</p>

<p class='c000'>Looking back, he could see the water coming in mountainous billows.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man had to be checked a trifle in order to turn into
the other canyon.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Barney made the turn all safely, and the Steam Man shot up
the canyon far enough to avoid the back current of the flood.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, I’m in luck this toime!” cried the Celt, jubilantly, as
he opened the whistle valve.</p>

<p class='c000'>The note of safety was heard by Frank and Pomp with a sensation
of great relief and joy.</p>

<p class='c000'>They understood at once the move made by Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That was a capital thought of Barney’s,” cried Frank. “It is
lucky that he did not keep on the plains. He would have been overtaken.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I jes’ reckon dat am a fac’!” cried Pomp. “Well, I fink we’d bettah
get back to de Steam Man as quick as eber we can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right, Pomp,” declared Frank. “Our position here will
be hardly a safe one now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Youse right, sah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The flood in the canyon was now rapidly subsiding.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great lake had quickly emptied itself into the canyon.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a short while the bed of the canyon was once more dry.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney then ran the Steam Man back into the main canyon, and
Frank and Pomp hailed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You did well, Barney!” cried the young inventor, joyfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You made the best possible move.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, I knew well enough that I had to git out of the way of
the wathers, sor,” replied Barney. “But shure, are yez comin’
down soon?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are comin’ right down,” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down the canyon wall they scrambled and safely reached the
gorge.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they greeted Barney with joy and clambered aboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, phwativer will yez do now, Misther Frank?” cried Barney,
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall follow the canyon up and try to dislodge the outlaws,”
replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very good, sir?” cried Barney, with readiness. “We’ll go ahead
thin?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney took the reins and the Steam Man went on up the gorge.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a short while they had reached the dam which had held back
the lake.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here a course was found directly out upon a vast plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was about to direct the man’s course thither when an incident
occurred to for a moment delay them.</p>

<p class='c000'>A loud and harsh voice came from the cliff above.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hello, down there!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The speaker could not be seen. The Steam Man came to a halt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ye’re Frank Reade, Jr., eh?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is my name.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wall, I’m Artemas Cliff. I give ye fair warnin’ to surrender.
Ye’re in a death trap.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you for informing us,” retorted Frank, “but I don’t believe
I’ll surrender yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ye won’t then?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then take the consequences.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can do that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A savage curse come down upon the air. Then the crack of rifles
was heard and bullets pattered against the steel netting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course no harm was done, and Frank only smiled grimly.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sent the Steam Man up the gorge, and in a few moments came
out upon the plain, which was deep among the hills and hemmed in
with a line of timber.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys continued to pour volley after volley into the Steam
Man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank waited until he had reached a favorable position.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he stopped the Steam Man, and picking up his rifle, said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come, boys! let’s give them as good as they send.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course Pomp and Barney were ready and eager.</p>

<p class='c000'>A destructive fire was sent into the covert of the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments it grew so hot that they could not remain there
and had to get out.</p>

<p class='c000'>With baffled yells they retreated deeper into the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whurroo!” yelled Barney jubilantly. “Shure it’s aisy enough
to whip such omadhouns as they be!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly! don’ yo’ be too suah, I’ish,” remonstrated Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do yez know about it, naygur?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Suah, I know jes’ as much as yo’ does, I’ish.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“G’long! Yez are a big stuff.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I amn’t so big a wan as yo’ am.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Say that agin, an’ I’ll break the face av yez.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Huh! Yo’ can’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The two rogues would have had a friendly set-to then and there
but Frank interposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“None of that,” he cried, sternly; “there is serious work before
us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a quietus upon the two rascals, and they ceased their
skylarking.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys had been driven back, but now a thrilling sound
came from the distant hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the heavy volleying of many rifles. There could be but
one explanation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Evidently the cavalry had come into conflict with the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>A good sized battle was in progress. An impulse seized Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He realized that he ought to join that conflict. There was
doubt but that the Steam Man could do much to aid the cavalry.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he started the Man across the plain, looking for an opening
into the hills in the direction of the firing.</p>

<p class='c000'>This it, however, seemed not easy to find.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as the Man was skirting the line of timber, a thrilling sound
was suddenly brought to view.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a small clearing in the verge of the timber two men were striving
to down one. It was a terrific and deadly struggle which was
in progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>The single fighter was holding his own well.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near by, with arms tied behind her, was a young girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Bessie Rodman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My God!” cried Frank. “Quick, for your life, boys! We must
put an end to that struggle. Don’t you see it is young Barney
and he is fighting to rescue the girl.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, dat am a fac’!” cried Pomp, excitedly. “Jes’ gib me a
chance at dem rapscallions.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Up to the spot the Steam Man swiftly ran.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cry of wildest joy and hope welled up from Bessie Rodman’s
lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>Young Barrows also saw that rescue was at hand and made extra
exertions to overcome his foes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys, however, seeing that succor had come tried to break
away.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Barrows was too exhausted to restrain them they succeeded
and dashed away at full speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reaching their ponies they mounted and were out of sight in a
twinkling.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next moment Barrows had clasped Bessie in his arms, first
cutting her bonds.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank Heaven!” he cried. “We are united once more, and this
time let us hope never to part.?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Those aboard the Steam Man pretended to be busy during the
affecting meeting.</p>

<p class='c000'>But soon the lovers came to the cage and a general welcome followed.</p>

<p class='c000'>An explanation of all followed, and then plans for the future
were quickly decided upon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <span class='large'>WHICH IS THE END.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The sound of firing now came from the hills quite plainly.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evident that Clark’s men were having a hard battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barrows detailed his experiences as we have recorded in a previous
chapter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then it was decided at once if possible to join the cavalry.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I can place Miss Rodman in your charge, Mr. Reade,” said
young Barrows, gallantly, “I will gladly join the soldiers and aid
in the repulse of the foe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You may do that,” replied Frank, readily. “In fact, I think it
safer for the lady to remain in the wagon hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are very kind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is nothing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly Bessie was given a seat in the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Barrows mounted one of the ponies left by the cowboys.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will see you later,” he said lifting his hat to Bessie.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Then he rode away to join the cavalry in their battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Steam Man, of course, could not hope to follow so quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fleet pony could go through narrow paths, and of course Barrows
reached the scene of action long before the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank Reade sent the Steam Man along at a good pace.</p>

<p class='c000'>After some search a pass was found, and the Man made its way
carefully through, and suddenly came out upon the field of action.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cowboys were strongly intrenched in the hills, and seemed
disposed to make a final stand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Col. Clark’s men were making desperate attempts to drive them
from their position.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Steam Man came dashing up to the spot a great cheer
went up from the soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank answered it by pulling the whistle valve of the Man and
sending up a sharp note.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Man could not hope to reach the position of the outlaws,
for the ground was too uneven.</p>

<p class='c000'>But a position was taken up from where the battle could be
easily watched.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Col. Clark came up to the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Warm greetings followed, and Frank said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is there anything I could do to help you, colonel?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think not,” replied the gallant officer. “I believe we shall
drive them out very soon now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I am not mistaken the day of Cliff and his gang are numbered.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is joyful news.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope you will succeed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The colonel rode away and the voyagers watched the contest with
interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>One watching the beautiful face of Bessie Rodman could have
seen that she was inwardly praying for her lover’s safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>But fortune was with the troops, though they had experienced a
hard battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The position of the outlaws was a very strong one and almost unassailable.</p>

<p class='c000'>High walls of rock were there for them to use as a breastwork.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not easy to dislodge them except at great loss of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Clark was not a man to be defeated.</p>

<p class='c000'>He urged his men on and slowly but surely drove the foe before
him. Frank Reade, Jr., now with Barney and Pomp and Bessie
Rodman on board, took the Steam Man out on to the prairie.</p>

<p class='c000'>For over an hour a kind of desultory conflict was kept up in
the hills.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Col. Clark suddenly came dashing up to the wagon.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have got them dislodged,” he cried. “And I think they
have struck out for Ranch V. Now if you will show us the way,
Mr. Reade, we will try and exterminate this poisonous gang.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“With pleasure!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He started the Steam Man at once for Ranch V.</p>

<p class='c000'>Across the prairie the machine ran rapidly, and the cavalry galloped
in the rear.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in the latter part of the day that all came out upon a rise
overlooking the stockade of Ranch V.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the cowboys had got there in advance and had made ready
for an attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>Col. Clark was a man of immediate resources.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without hesitation or a moment’s delay he threw his men forward
on the charge. At almost the first attack the gate was carried
and the soldiers entered the yard.</p>

<p class='c000'>But step by step Artemus Cliff contested the way.</p>

<p class='c000'>His men by divisions surrendered half a dozen or more at a time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being thus made prisoners, they were sent to the rear. In this
manner the numbers of the cowboy gang were decimated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly a thrilling cry went up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fire! Fire!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The stockade and ranch proper had been fired, and great columns
of flame now arose.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scene was fast becoming a thrilling one. Darkness was coming
on, and the rattle of firearms the dark shadows of night partially
dispelled by the flames, gave a weird aspect to everything.</p>

<p class='c000'>Slow but sure was the conquest of Cliff and his gang.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now he was driven to his last resort, the corner of the stockade
nearest the river. Scarce a score of his followers now remained.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was utterly no use for him to resist longer. The villain saw it
but yet kept on fighting doggedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Surrender, or die!” cried the lieutenant who led the squad. “It
is your only chance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The remaining cowboys threw up their hands. But Cliff pitched
forward in a heap upon the ground, struck by a pistol ball.</p>

<p class='c000'>There he was found later under a heap of dead men. He was removed
to the camp near and his wounds examined.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ranch V was a thing of the past.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not a stick was left standing, and of the cowboy gang fully a
hundred had rendered up their final account.</p>

<p class='c000'>Possibly twenty of the cavalrymen had been killed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been quite a severe battle, but Frank Reade, Jr., and his
companions could not help but feel overjoyed at the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp had an old time set-to over the victory, this
time Pomp coming off victorious.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night was passed quietly. Early the next morning a surgeon
came to the Steam Man and called for Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>He announced that Cliff was dying, and wanted to make a confession
but would make it to nobody else.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank hurried to the dying couch of the villain. Cliff’s filmy gaze
was fixed upon him eagerly, and he said, huskily:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Reade, I’m done for. I made a good fight but I’ve lost. The
game’s up. I might as well make a clean breast of it. Uncle Jim is
innocent of Rodman’s death. Sid Bowen and Jim Ducey, my
trusted pals, killed Rodman and worked the whole game. That’s all.
I reckon I can die better now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have done a good deed, Artemus Cliff,” said Frank, kindly.
“And may God forgive you your sins.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the villain did not answer. Already his eyes were set. The
Master had called him. He had cheated the gallows after all.</p>

<p class='c000'>A grave was dug on the prairie and Frank saw that he was properly
buried.</p>

<p class='c000'>The confession was put in writing and duly witnessed. The mission
of the new Steam Man to the far west was ended.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>The spirits of all were bright and cheerful, now that the end had
come.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extermination of the Cliff gang was certainly a blessing to
that part of the State, and no one regretted the villain’s demise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Preparations were now made for the return home.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, Col. Clark and his command would return to the fort,
but Frank now thought of Bessie Rodman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By Jupiter!” he muttered, “something must be done for her.
Poor girl! she is without a friend in the world now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp winked at each other, and Barney cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, Misther Frank, have yez lost yer powers av penetration?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I reckon yo’ am way off, Marse Frank,” rejoined Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are you fellows driving at?” asked Frank, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, dat ar’ gal, she am got one ob de bes’ friends in de worl’.
Jes’ yo’ cast yo’ eye ober dar an’ see dat spruce young feller what am
walkin’ wid her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank did “cast his eye” in the direction indicated, and saw
Bessie and young Walter Barrows approaching.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a particularly happy light upon the faces of both.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pshaw!” muttered Frank. “That young fellow can’t marry her
yet. She’s got to have a home in the meanwhile. Miss Rodman,
one moment, please.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The lovers paused, and Frank said brusquely:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can understand your position, Bessie, very well, and I know
that you need a home. I can only offer to take you to Readestown
with me, and my wife will do all in her power——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“One moment, sir,” said Barrows, with burning face. “You are
very kind, but let me first explain. I am this lady’s natural protector
for life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What?” gasped Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, she is my wife.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp and Barney collapsed at the expression upon Frank’s face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your wife?” gasped the young inventor. “When were you
married?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just now, and the ceremony was performed by the chaplain of
the regiment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank thrust forth his right hand, and gave Barrows a grip which
made him wince.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must pardon my conduct,” he cried, “but it was such a
surprise. I wish you both worlds of happiness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Some hours later the new Steam Man was on its way homeward.
A week later it was in Omaha, Nebraska, and not long thereafter
was at home in Readestown.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor was received at home with an ovation, and
his father, the distinguished Reade Senior, was overjoyed to learn
that the evidence had been procured to clear Travers.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the latter he came from prison like one coming into a new
life and from that time on regarded Frank Reade, Jr. as his greatest
earthly benefactor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new Steam Man and his wonderful western trip was the talk
of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>People came from near and far to see the invention and it was not
long before the young inventor suddenly found himself involved in
another daring project.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new Steam Man was destined to make another trip, and become
involved in adventures even more thrilling than these just
recorded, and a full and detailed account of the second trip may be
found in</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
